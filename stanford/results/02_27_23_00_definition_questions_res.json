Types of Measurement Scales Different statistical methods use different levels of measurement, or measurement scales. Measurement scales may be classified into one of four major categories: Nominal scales. Nominal scales are the level of measurement that contains the least information. Observations are classified or counted with no particular order. An example would be assigning the number 1 to a municipal bond fund, the number 2 to a corporate bond fund, and so on for each fund style. Ordinal scales. Ordinal scales represent a higher level of measurement than nominal scales. When working with an ordinal scale, every observation is assigned to one of several categories. Then these categories are ordered with respect to a specified characteristic. For example, the ranking of 1,000 small cap growth stocks by performance may be done by assigning the number 1 to the 100 best performing stocks, the number 2 to the next 100 best performing stocks, and so on, assigning the number 10 to the 100 worst performing stocks. Based on this type of measurement, it can be concluded that a stock ranked 3 is better than a stock ranked 4, but the scale reveals nothing about performance differences or whether the difference between a 3 and a 4 is the same as the difference between a 4 and a 5. Interval scale. Interval scale measurements provide relative ranking, like ordinal scales, plus the assurance that differences between scale values are equal. Temperature measurement in degrees is a prime example. Certainly, 49\u00b0C is hotter than 32\u00b0C, and the temperature difference between 49\u00b0C and 32\u00b0C is the same as the difference between 67\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C. The weakness of the interval scale is that a measurement of zero does not necessarily indicate the total absence of what we are measuring. This means that interval-scale-based ratios are meaningless. For example, 30\u00b0F is not three times as hot as 10\u00b0F. Ratio scales. Ratio scales represent the most refined level of measurement. Ratio scales provide ranking and equal differences between scale values, and they also have a true zero point as the origin. Order, intervals, and ratios all make sense with a ratio scale. The measurement of money is a good example. If you have zero dollars, you have no purchasing power, but if you have $4.00, you have twice as much purchasing power as a person with $2.00.

B A higher debt/EBITDA ratio is sign of higher leverage and higher credit risk. Higher FFO/debt and EBITDA/interest expense ratios indicate lower credit risk. 7. C A low debt/capital ratio is an indicator of low leverage. An issuer rated AAA is likely to have a high operating margin and a high FFO/debt ratio compared to its industry group. 8. B Credit spreads widen as economic conditions worsen. Spreads narrow as the credit cycle improves and as broker-dealers provide more capital to bond markets. 9. c Longer duration bonds usually have longer maturities and carry more uncertainty of future creditworthiness. 10.

Firms differentiate their products through features and marketing with claims of more attractiveness, whiter teeth, fresher breath, and even of actually cleaning your teeth and preventing decay. If the price of your personal favorite increases, you are not likely to immediately switch to another brand as under perfect competition. Some customers would switch in response to a 10% increase in price and some would not. This is why firm demand is downward sloping. The most important characteristic of an oligopoly market is that there are only a few firms competing. In such a market, each firm must consider the actions and responses of other firms in setting price and business strategy. We say that such firms are interdependent. While products are typically good substitutes for each other, they may be either quite similar or differentiated through features, branding, marketing, and quality. Barriers to entry are high, often because economies of scale in production or marketing lead to very large firms. Demand can be more or less elastic than for firms in monopolistic competition. The automobile market is dominated by a few very large firms and can be characterized as an oligopoly. The product and pricing decisions of Toyota certainly affect those of Ford and vice versa. Automobile makers compete based on price, but also through marketing, product features, and quality, which is often signaled strongly through brand name. The oil industry also has a few dominant firms but their products are very good substitutes for each other. A monopoly market is characterized by a single seller of a product with no close substitutes. This fact alone means that the firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve (the market demand curve) and has the power to choose the price at which it sells its product. High barriers to entry protect a monopoly producer from competition. One source of monopoly power is the protection offered by copyrights and patents. Another possible source of monopoly power is control over a resource specifically needed to produce the product. Most frequently, monopoly power is supported by government. A natural monopoly refers to a situation where the average cost of production is falling over the relevant range of consumer demand. In this case, having two (or more) producers would result in a significantly higher cost of production and be detrimental to consumers. Examples of natural monopolies include the electric power and distribution business and other public utilities. When privately owned companies are granted such monopoly power, the price they charge is often regulated by government as well. Sometimes market power is the result of network effects or synergies that make it very difficult to compete with a company once it has reached a critical level of market penetration. EBay gained such a large share of the online auction market that its information on buyers and sellers and the number of buyers who visit eBay essentially precluded others from establishing competing businesses. While it may have competition to some degree, its market share is such that it has negatively sloped demand and a good deal of pricing power. Sometimes we refer to such companies as having a moat around them that protects them from competition. It is best to remember, however, that changes in technology and consumer tastes can, and usually do, reduce market power over time.

Obligations might include interest and principal payments on debt, payments on accounts payable and income taxes. More specifically, a firm is technically insolvent if it cannot meet its current obligations as they come due, despite the value of its assets exceeding the value of its liabilities. A firm is legally insolvent if the value of its assets is less than the value of its liabilities. A firm is bankrupt if it is unable to pay its debts and files a bankruptcy petition.Solvency is measured with a liquidity ration called the \"current ratio,\" a comparison between current assets (including cash on hand and any assets that could be converted into cash within 12 months such as inventory, receivables and supplies) and current liabilities (debts that are due within the next 12 months, such as interest and principal payments on debt serviced, payroll and payroll taxes). There are many ways to interpret the current ratio. For example, the textbook \"Contemporary Financial Management\" considers a 2:1 current ratio as solvent, showing that the firm's current assets are twice its current liabilities. In other words, the firm's assets would cover its current liabilities about two times. When a public company is unable to meet its debt obligations and files for protection under bankruptcy, it can reorganize its business in an attempt to become profitable, or it can close its operations, sell off its assets and use the proceeds to pay off its debts (a process called \"liquidation\").

Firms differentiate their products through features and marketing with claims of more attractiveness, whiter teeth, fresher breath, and even of actually cleaning your teeth and preventing decay. If the price of your personal favorite increases, you are not likely to immediately switch to another brand as under perfect competition. Some customers would switch in response to a 10% increase in price and some would not. This is why firm demand is downward sloping. The most important characteristic of an oligopoly market is that there are only a few firms competing. In such a market, each firm must consider the actions and responses of other firms in setting price and business strategy. We say that such firms are interdependent. While products are typically good substitutes for each other, they may be either quite similar or differentiated through features, branding, marketing, and quality. Barriers to entry are high, often because economies of scale in production or marketing lead to very large firms. Demand can be more or less elastic than for firms in monopolistic competition. The automobile market is dominated by a few very large firms and can be characterized as an oligopoly. The product and pricing decisions of Toyota certainly affect those of Ford and vice versa. Automobile makers compete based on price, but also through marketing, product features, and quality, which is often signaled strongly through brand name. The oil industry also has a few dominant firms but their products are very good substitutes for each other. A monopoly market is characterized by a single seller of a product with no close substitutes. This fact alone means that the firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve (the market demand curve) and has the power to choose the price at which it sells its product. High barriers to entry protect a monopoly producer from competition. One source of monopoly power is the protection offered by copyrights and patents. Another possible source of monopoly power is control over a resource specifically needed to produce the product. Most frequently, monopoly power is supported by government. A natural monopoly refers to a situation where the average cost of production is falling over the relevant range of consumer demand. In this case, having two (or more) producers would result in a significantly higher cost of production and be detrimental to consumers. Examples of natural monopolies include the electric power and distribution business and other public utilities. When privately owned companies are granted such monopoly power, the price they charge is often regulated by government as well. Sometimes market power is the result of network effects or synergies that make it very difficult to compete with a company once it has reached a critical level of market penetration. EBay gained such a large share of the online auction market that its information on buyers and sellers and the number of buyers who visit eBay essentially precluded others from establishing competing businesses. While it may have competition to some degree, its market share is such that it has negatively sloped demand and a good deal of pricing power. Sometimes we refer to such companies as having a moat around them that protects them from competition. It is best to remember, however, that changes in technology and consumer tastes can, and usually do, reduce market power over time.
