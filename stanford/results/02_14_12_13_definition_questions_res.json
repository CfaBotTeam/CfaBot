A Portfolio duration is limited as a measure of interest rate risk because it assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve; that is, the discount rate at each maturity changes by the same amount. Portfolio duration can be calculated using effective durations of bonds with embedded options. By definition, a portfolio's internal rate of return is equal to its cash flow yield. 8. B PVBP = initial price - price if yield is changed by 1 basis point. First, we need to calculate the yield so we can calculate the price of the bond with a 1 basis point change in yield. Using a financial calculator: PV= -1,029.23; FV= 1,000; PMT= 27.5 = (0.055 x 1,000) / 2; N =14 = 2 x 7 years; CPT + I/Y = 2.49998, multiplied by 2 = 4.99995, or 5.00%. Next, compute the price of the bond at a yield of 5.00% + 0.01%, or 5.01%. Using the calculator: FV= 1,000; PMT= 27.5; N = 14; I/Y = 2.505 (5.01 / 2); CPT + PV= $1,028.63. Finally, PVBP = $1,029.23 \u2013 $1,028.63 = $0.60. 9. B When the YTM of a callable bond falls, the increase in price is less than for an optionfree bond because both bond price and the value of the call option increase. Callable bond value = straight bond value \u2013 call option value. 10. B The interest rate sensitivity of a bond with an embedded call option will be less than that of an option-free bond. Effective duration takes the effect of the call option into account and will, therefore, be less than Macaulay or modified duration."}]}, {"question": "On 7 January 2008, an investor purchases 100 shares of stock for $32.50 a share.

If the price of a product increases because the product has improved, the price increase is not due to inflation but still increases the price index. Substitution. Even in an inflation-free economy, prices of goods relative to each other change all the time. When two goods are substitutes for each other, consumers increase their purchases of the relatively cheaper good and buy less of the relatively more expensive good. Over time, such changes can make a Laspeyres index's fixed basket of goods a less accurate measure of typical household spending. A technique known as hedonic pricing can be used to adjust a price index for product quality.

The source of comparative advantage (differences in opportunity costs) in this model is differences in the relative amounts of each factor the countries possess. We can view the England and Portugal example in these terms by assuming that England has more capital (machinery) compared to labor than Portugal. Additionally, we need to assume that cloth production is more capital intensive than wine production. The result of their analysis is that the country that has more capital will specialize in the capital intensive good and trade for the less capital intensive good with the country that has relatively more labor and less capital. In the Heckscher-Ohlin model, there is a redistribution of wealth within each country between labor and the owners of capital. The price of the relatively less scarce (more available) factor of production in each country will increase so that owners of capital will earn more in England, and workers will earn more in Portugal compared to what they were without trade. This is easy to understand in the context of prices of the two goods. The good that a country imports will fall in price (that is why they import it), and the good that a country exports will rise in price. In our example, this means that the price of wine falls, and the price of cloth rises in England. Because with trade, more of the capital-intensive good, cloth, is produced in England, demand for capital and the price of capital will increase in England. As a result, capital receives more income at the expense of labor in England. In Portugal, increasing the production of wine (which is labor intensive) increases the demand for and price of labor, and workers gain at the expense of the owners of capital."}]}, {"question": "Suppose inflation increases due to increases in government spending and a reduction in taxes.

Firms differentiate their products through features and marketing with claims of more attractiveness, whiter teeth, fresher breath, and even of actually cleaning your teeth and preventing decay. If the price of your personal favorite increases, you are not likely to immediately switch to another brand as under perfect competition. Some customers would switch in response to a 10% increase in price and some would not. This is why firm demand is downward sloping. The most important characteristic of an oligopoly market is that there are only a few firms competing. In such a market, each firm must consider the actions and responses of other firms in setting price and business strategy. We say that such firms are interdependent. While products are typically good substitutes for each other, they may be either quite similar or differentiated through features, branding, marketing, and quality. Barriers to entry are high, often because economies of scale in production or marketing lead to very large firms. Demand can be more or less elastic than for firms in monopolistic competition. The automobile market is dominated by a few very large firms and can be characterized as an oligopoly. The product and pricing decisions of Toyota certainly affect those of Ford and vice versa. Automobile makers compete based on price, but also through marketing, product features, and quality, which is often signaled strongly through brand name. The oil industry also has a few dominant firms but their products are very good substitutes for each other. A monopoly market is characterized by a single seller of a product with no close substitutes. This fact alone means that the firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve (the market demand curve) and has the power to choose the price at which it sells its product. High barriers to entry protect a monopoly producer from competition. One source of monopoly power is the protection offered by copyrights and patents. Another possible source of monopoly power is control over a resource specifically needed to produce the product. Most frequently, monopoly power is supported by government. A natural monopoly refers to a situation where the average cost of production is falling over the relevant range of consumer demand. In this case, having two (or more) producers would result in a significantly higher cost of production and be detrimental to consumers. Examples of natural monopolies include the electric power and distribution business and other public utilities. When privately owned companies are granted such monopoly power, the price they charge is often regulated by government as well. Sometimes market power is the result of network effects or synergies that make it very difficult to compete with a company once it has reached a critical level of market penetration. EBay gained such a large share of the online auction market that its information on buyers and sellers and the number of buyers who visit eBay essentially precluded others from establishing competing businesses. While it may have competition to some degree, its market share is such that it has negatively sloped demand and a good deal of pricing power. Sometimes we refer to such companies as having a moat around them that protects them from competition.

Firms differentiate their products through features and marketing with claims of more attractiveness, whiter teeth, fresher breath, and even of actually cleaning your teeth and preventing decay. If the price of your personal favorite increases, you are not likely to immediately switch to another brand as under perfect competition. Some customers would switch in response to a 10% increase in price and some would not. This is why firm demand is downward sloping. The most important characteristic of an oligopoly market is that there are only a few firms competing. In such a market, each firm must consider the actions and responses of other firms in setting price and business strategy. We say that such firms are interdependent. While products are typically good substitutes for each other, they may be either quite similar or differentiated through features, branding, marketing, and quality. Barriers to entry are high, often because economies of scale in production or marketing lead to very large firms. Demand can be more or less elastic than for firms in monopolistic competition. The automobile market is dominated by a few very large firms and can be characterized as an oligopoly. The product and pricing decisions of Toyota certainly affect those of Ford and vice versa. Automobile makers compete based on price, but also through marketing, product features, and quality, which is often signaled strongly through brand name. The oil industry also has a few dominant firms but their products are very good substitutes for each other. A monopoly market is characterized by a single seller of a product with no close substitutes. This fact alone means that the firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve (the market demand curve) and has the power to choose the price at which it sells its product. High barriers to entry protect a monopoly producer from competition. One source of monopoly power is the protection offered by copyrights and patents. Another possible source of monopoly power is control over a resource specifically needed to produce the product. Most frequently, monopoly power is supported by government. A natural monopoly refers to a situation where the average cost of production is falling over the relevant range of consumer demand. In this case, having two (or more) producers would result in a significantly higher cost of production and be detrimental to consumers. Examples of natural monopolies include the electric power and distribution business and other public utilities. When privately owned companies are granted such monopoly power, the price they charge is often regulated by government as well. Sometimes market power is the result of network effects or synergies that make it very difficult to compete with a company once it has reached a critical level of market penetration. EBay gained such a large share of the online auction market that its information on buyers and sellers and the number of buyers who visit eBay essentially precluded others from establishing competing businesses. While it may have competition to some degree, its market share is such that it has negatively sloped demand and a good deal of pricing power. Sometimes we refer to such companies as having a moat around them that protects them from competition. It is best to remember, however, that changes in technology and consumer tastes can, and usually do, reduce market power over time. Polaroid had a monopoly on instant photos for years, but the introduction of digital photography forced the firm into bankruptcy in 2001."}]}, {"question": "Which of the following statements best describes an advantage of a forward contract over a futures contract?

Values for individual properties include adjustments for differences between the characteristics of the specific property and those of the properties for which recent sales prices are available, such as age, location, condition, and size. The income approach estimates property values by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows from property ownership or by dividing the net operating income (NOI) for a property by a capitalization (cap) rate. The cap rate is a discount rate minus a growth rate and is estimated based on factors such as general business conditions, property qualities, management effectiveness, and sales of comparable properties. Note that dividing by a cap rate of 12.5% is the same as using a multiple of 8 times NOI (1 / 0.125 = 8). The cost approach estimates the replacement cost of a property. The cost of land and the cost of rebuilding at current construction costs are added to estimate replacement cost. Value estimates for real estate investment trusts can be income based or asset based. The income-based approach is similar to the income approach for a specific property and uses some measure of cash flow and a cap rate based on the factors we noted previously for the income approach. One measure of cash flow for a REIT is funds from operations (FFO). FFO is calculated from net income with depreciation added back (because depreciation is a non-cash charge) and with gains from property sales subtracted and losses on property sales added (because these gains and losses are assumed to be nonrecurring). A second measure of cash flow is adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), which is FFO with recurring capital expenditures subtracted. AFFO is similar to free cash flow.

Values for individual properties include adjustments for differences between the characteristics of the specific property and those of the properties for which recent sales prices are available, such as age, location, condition, and size. The income approach estimates property values by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows from property ownership or by dividing the net operating income (NOI) for a property by a capitalization (cap) rate. The cap rate is a discount rate minus a growth rate and is estimated based on factors such as general business conditions, property qualities, management effectiveness, and sales of comparable properties. Note that dividing by a cap rate of 12.5% is the same as using a multiple of 8 times NOI (1 / 0.125 = 8). The cost approach estimates the replacement cost of a property. The cost of land and the cost of rebuilding at current construction costs are added to estimate replacement cost. Value estimates for real estate investment trusts can be income based or asset based. The income-based approach is similar to the income approach for a specific property and uses some measure of cash flow and a cap rate based on the factors we noted previously for the income approach. One measure of cash flow for a REIT is funds from operations (FFO). FFO is calculated from net income with depreciation added back (because depreciation is a non-cash charge) and with gains from property sales subtracted and losses on property sales added (because these gains and losses are assumed to be nonrecurring). A second measure of cash flow is adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), which is FFO with recurring capital expenditures subtracted. AFFO is similar to free cash flow.

Firms differentiate their products through features and marketing with claims of more attractiveness, whiter teeth, fresher breath, and even of actually cleaning your teeth and preventing decay. If the price of your personal favorite increases, you are not likely to immediately switch to another brand as under perfect competition. Some customers would switch in response to a 10% increase in price and some would not. This is why firm demand is downward sloping. The most important characteristic of an oligopoly market is that there are only a few firms competing. In such a market, each firm must consider the actions and responses of other firms in setting price and business strategy. We say that such firms are interdependent. While products are typically good substitutes for each other, they may be either quite similar or differentiated through features, branding, marketing, and quality. Barriers to entry are high, often because economies of scale in production or marketing lead to very large firms. Demand can be more or less elastic than for firms in monopolistic competition. The automobile market is dominated by a few very large firms and can be characterized as an oligopoly. The product and pricing decisions of Toyota certainly affect those of Ford and vice versa. Automobile makers compete based on price, but also through marketing, product features, and quality, which is often signaled strongly through brand name. The oil industry also has a few dominant firms but their products are very good substitutes for each other. A monopoly market is characterized by a single seller of a product with no close substitutes. This fact alone means that the firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve (the market demand curve) and has the power to choose the price at which it sells its product. High barriers to entry protect a monopoly producer from competition. One source of monopoly power is the protection offered by copyrights and patents. Another possible source of monopoly power is control over a resource specifically needed to produce the product. Most frequently, monopoly power is supported by government. A natural monopoly refers to a situation where the average cost of production is falling over the relevant range of consumer demand. In this case, having two (or more) producers would result in a significantly higher cost of production and be detrimental to consumers. Examples of natural monopolies include the electric power and distribution business and other public utilities. When privately owned companies are granted such monopoly power, the price they charge is often regulated by government as well. Sometimes market power is the result of network effects or synergies that make it very difficult to compete with a company once it has reached a critical level of market penetration. EBay gained such a large share of the online auction market that its information on buyers and sellers and the number of buyers who visit eBay essentially precluded others from establishing competing businesses. While it may have competition to some degree, its market share is such that it has negatively sloped demand and a good deal of pricing power. Sometimes we refer to such companies as having a moat around them that protects them from competition. It is best to remember, however, that changes in technology and consumer tastes can, and usually do, reduce market power over time.

This fact alone means that the firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve (the market demand curve) and has the power to choose the price at which it sells its product. High barriers to entry protect a monopoly producer from competition. One source of monopoly power is the protection offered by copyrights and patents. Another possible source of monopoly power is control over a resource specifically needed to produce the product. Most frequently, monopoly power is supported by government. A natural monopoly refers to a situation where the average cost of production is falling over the relevant range of consumer demand. In this case, having two (or more) producers would result in a significantly higher cost of production and be detrimental to consumers. Examples of natural monopolies include the electric power and distribution business and other public utilities. When privately owned companies are granted such monopoly power, the price they charge is often regulated by government as well. Sometimes market power is the result of network effects or synergies that make it very difficult to compete with a company once it has reached a critical level of market penetration. EBay gained such a large share of the online auction market that its information on buyers and sellers and the number of buyers who visit eBay essentially precluded others from establishing competing businesses. While it may have competition to some degree, its market share is such that it has negatively sloped demand and a good deal of pricing power. Sometimes we refer to such companies as having a moat around them that protects them from competition. It is best to remember, however, that changes in technology and consumer tastes can, and usually do, reduce market power over time. Polaroid had a monopoly on instant photos for years, but the introduction of digital photography forced the firm into bankruptcy in 2001."}]}, {"question": "The type of voting in board elections that is most beneficial to shareholders with a small number of shares is best described as:", "answer": "A", "choices": ["cumulative voting.", "statutory voting.", "voting by proxy."], "best_matches": [{"choice": "cumulative voting.", "span": "staggered", "similarity": -0.03712160512804985}, {"choice": "statutory voting.", "span": "staggered", "similarity": -0.03712160512804985}, {"choice": "voting by proxy.", "span": "staggered", "similarity": -0.03712160512804985}], "is_correct": true, "predictions": [{"span": "staggered", "context": "Currently, the general practice is for all board member elections to be held at the same meeting and each election to be for multiple years.

Require minimum standards of competency and make it easier for investors to evaluate performance. The CFA Program and the Global Investment Performance Standards are part of this effort. Prevent insiders from exploiting other investors. Require common financial reporting requirements (e.g., those of the International Accounting Standards Board) so that information gathering is less expensive. Require minimum levels of capital so that market participants will be able to honor their long-term commitments. This is especially important for insurance companies and pension funds that individuals depend on for their financial future. With capital at stake, market participants have more incentive to be careful about the risks they take. Regulation can be provided by governments as well as industry groups. For example, most exchanges, clearinghouses, and dealer trade organizations are self-regulating organizations (SROs), meaning that they regulate their members. Governments sometimes delegate regulatory authority to SROs."}]}, {"question": "A stock is declining in price and reaches a price range wherein buying activity is sufficient to stop the decline.

B The total purchase price is 1,000 x $50 = $50,000. The investor must post initial margin of 40% x $50,000 = $20,000. The remaining $30,000 is borrowed. The commission on the purchase is 1,000 x $0.01 = $10. Thus, the initial equity investment is $20,010. In one year, the sales price is 1,000 x $56 = $56,000. Dividends received are 1,000 x $0.30 = $300. Interest paid is $30,000 x 3% = $900. The commission on the sale is 1,000 x $0.01 = $10. Thus the ending value is $56,000 - $30,000 + $300 - $900 - $10 = $25,390. The return on the equity investment is $25,390 / $20,010 - 1 = 26.89%. 5. A If the investor believes the stock is overvalued in the market, the investor should place a short-sale order, which would be profitable if the stock moves toward her value estimate. 6. B A behind-the-market limit order would be least likely executed. In the case of a buy, the limit buy order price is below the best bid. It will likely not execute until security prices decline. A marketable buy order is the most likely to trade because it is close to the best ask price. In an order that is making a new market or inside the market, the limit buy order price is between the best bid and ask. 7.

A Each country gains by exporting the good for which it has a comparative advantage. 4. C In the Ricardian model, labor is the only factor of production considered. In the Heckscher-Ohlin model, comparative advantage results from the relative amounts of labor and capital available in different countries. 5.

A Import quotas and voluntary export restraints, unlike tariffs, do not necessarily generate tax revenue. The other choices describe effects that result from tariffs, quotas, and VERs. 7. B Imposing a tariff on steel imports benefits domestic steel producers and workers by increasing the domestic price of steel and benefits the national government by increasing tax (tariff) revenue. However, the increase in the domestic price of steel would increase costs in industries that use significant amounts of steel, such as the automobile industry. The resulting increase in the price of automobiles reduces the quantity of automobiles demanded and ultimately reduces employment in that industry. 8.

A float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index is constructed like a market capitalization-weighted index. The weights, however, are based on the proportionate value of each firm's shares that are available to investors to the total market value of the shares of index stocks that are available to investors. Firms with relatively large percentages of their shares held by controlling stockholders will have less weight than they have in an unadjusted market-capitalization index. The advantage of market capitalization-weighted indexes of either type is that index security weights represent proportions of total market value. The primary disadvantage of value-weighted indexes is that the relative impact of a stock's return on the index increases as its price rises and decreases as its price falls. This means that stocks that are possibly overvalued are given disproportionately high weights in the index and stocks that are possibly undervalued are given disproportionately low weights. Holding a portfolio that tracks a value-weighted index is, therefore, similar to following a momentum strategy, under which the most successful stocks are given the greatest weights and poor performing stocks are underweighted."}]}, {"question": "The behavioral bias in which investors tend to avoid realizing losses but rather seek to realize gains is best described as:", "answer": "B", "choices": ["the gambler's fallacy.", "the disposition effect.", "mental accounting."], "best_matches": [{"choice": "the gambler's fallacy.", "span": "hedge", "similarity": -0.03268435597419739}, {"choice": "the disposition effect.", "span": "hedge", "similarity": -0.03268435597419739}, {"choice": "mental accounting.", "span": "hedge", "similarity": -0.015424623154103756}], "is_correct": false, "predictions": [{"span": "hedge", "context": "4. Equity hedge fund strategies seek to profit from long or short positions in publicly traded equities and derivatives with equities as their underlying assets. Market neutral: Use technical or fundamental analysis to select undervalued equities to be held long, and to select overvalued equities to be sold short, in approximately equal amounts to profit from their relative price movements without exposure to market risk. Fundamental growth: Use fundamental analysis to find high-growth companies. Identify and buy equities of companies that are expected to sustain relatively high rates of capital appreciation. Fundamental value: Buy equity shares that are believed to be undervalued based on fundamental analysis. Here it is the hedge fund structure, rather than the type of assets purchased, that results in classification as an alternative investment. Quantitative directional: Buy equity securities believed to be undervalued and short securities believed to be overvalued based on technical analysis. Market exposure may vary depending on relative size of long and short portfolio positions.
