SPI made $100 million in profits for the recent quarter, and because only 70% of these profits will be reinvested back into the company, SPI's Board of Directors is considering two alternatives for distributing the remaining 30% to shareholders: \u2022 Pay a cash dividend of $30,000,000 / 20,000,000 shares = $1.50 per share. \u2022 Repurchase $30,000,000 worth of common stock. Assume that dividends are received when the shares go ex-dividend, the stock can be repurchased at the market price of $50 per share, and there are no differences in tax treatment between the two alternatives. How would the wealth of an SPI shareholder be affected by the board's decision on the method of distribution? Answer: (1) Cash dividend After the shares go ex-dividend, a shareholder of a single share would have $1.50 in cash and a share worth $50 \u2013 $1.50 = $48.50.

B Both monetary and fiscal policies primarily strive to achieve economic targets such as inflation and GDP growth. Balancing the budget is not a goal for monetary policy and is a potential outcome of fiscal policy.

Money existed long before the idea of central banking was conceived. 3. C The money multiplier is 1 / 0.15 = 6.67, so the open market purchase can increase the money supply by a maximum of $6.67 billion. 4. A Money neutrality is the theory that changes in the money supply do not affect real output or the velocity of money. Therefore, an increase in the money supply can only increase the price level. 5. C Given the equation of exchange, MV = PY, an increase in the money supply is consistent with an increase in nominal GDP (PY). However, a decrease in velocity is consistent with a decrease in nominal GDP. Unless we know the size of the changes in the two variables, there is no way to tell what the net impact is on real GDP (Y) and prices (P). 6. B The equation of exchange is MV = PY. Nominal GDP = PY, so that MV = nominal GDP. Therefore, ($1.0 trillion)(V) = $7.0 trillion. V = $7.0 trillion / $1.0 trillion V = 7.0 7. A The money supply schedule is vertical because the money supply is independent of interest rates. Central banks control the money supply. 8.

B Lending money to government agencies is not typically a function of a central bank. Central bank functions include controlling the country's money supply to keep inflation within acceptable levels and promoting a sustainable rate of economic growth, as well as issuing currency and regulating banks. 11.

Indexes provide a representative market return and thus reflect investor confidence. Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average is a popular index, it reflects the performance of only 30 stocks and thus may not be a good measure of sentiment with regard to the broader market. Benchmark of manager performance. An index can be used to evaluate the performance of an active manager. Because portfolio performance depends to a large degree on its chosen style, the benchmark should be consistent with the manager's investment approach and style to assess the manager's skill accurately. The index stocks should be those that the manager will actually choose from. For example, a value manager should be compared against a value index, not a broad market index, because portfolio securities will be selected from among value stocks. Measure of market return and risk. In asset allocation, estimates of the expected return and standard deviation of returns for various asset classes are based on historical returns for an index of securities representing that asset class. Measure of beta and risk-adjusted return. The use of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to determine a stock's expected return requires an estimate of its beta and the return on the market. Index portfolio returns are used as a proxy for the returns on the market portfolio, both in estimating a stock's beta, and then again in calculating its expected return based on its systematic (beta) risk. Expected returns can then be compared to actual stock returns to determine systematic risk-adjusted returns. Model portfolio for index funds.

The source of differences in production costs in Ricardo's model is differences in labor productivity due to differences in technology. Heckscher and Ohlin presented a model in which there are two factors of production\u2013 capital and labor. The source of comparative advantage (differences in opportunity costs) in this model is differences in the relative amounts of each factor the countries possess. We can view the England and Portugal example in these terms by assuming that England has more capital (machinery) compared to labor than Portugal. Additionally, we need to assume that cloth production is more capital intensive than wine production. The result of their analysis is that the country that has more capital will specialize in the capital intensive good and trade for the less capital intensive good with the country that has relatively more labor and less capital. In the Heckscher-Ohlin model, there is a redistribution of wealth within each country between labor and the owners of capital. The price of the relatively less scarce (more available) factor of production in each country will increase so that owners of capital will earn more in England, and workers will earn more in Portugal compared to what they were without trade. This is easy to understand in the context of prices of the two goods. The good that a country imports will fall in price (that is why they import it), and the good that a country exports will rise in price. In our example, this means that the price of wine falls, and the price of cloth rises in England. Because with trade, more of the capital-intensive good, cloth, is produced in England, demand for capital and the price of capital will increase in England.
