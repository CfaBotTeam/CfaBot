Firms differentiate their products through features and marketing with claims of more attractiveness, whiter teeth, fresher breath, and even of actually cleaning your teeth and preventing decay. If the price of your personal favorite increases, you are not likely to immediately switch to another brand as under perfect competition. Some customers would switch in response to a 10% increase in price and some would not. This is why firm demand is downward sloping. The most important characteristic of an oligopoly market is that there are only a few firms competing. In such a market, each firm must consider the actions and responses of other firms in setting price and business strategy. We say that such firms are interdependent. While products are typically good substitutes for each other, they may be either quite similar or differentiated through features, branding, marketing, and quality. Barriers to entry are high, often because economies of scale in production or marketing lead to very large firms. Demand can be more or less elastic than for firms in monopolistic competition. The automobile market is dominated by a few very large firms and can be characterized as an oligopoly. The product and pricing decisions of Toyota certainly affect those of Ford and vice versa. Automobile makers compete based on price, but also through marketing, product features, and quality, which is often signaled strongly through brand name. The oil industry also has a few dominant firms but their products are very good substitutes for each other. A monopoly market is characterized by a single seller of a product with no close substitutes. This fact alone means that the firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve (the market demand curve) and has the power to choose the price at which it sells its product. High barriers to entry protect a monopoly producer from competition. One source of monopoly power is the protection offered by copyrights and patents. Another possible source of monopoly power is control over a resource specifically needed to produce the product. Most frequently, monopoly power is supported by government. A natural monopoly refers to a situation where the average cost of production is falling over the relevant range of consumer demand. In this case, having two (or more) producers would result in a significantly higher cost of production and be detrimental to consumers. Examples of natural monopolies include the electric power and distribution business and other public utilities. When privately owned companies are granted such monopoly power, the price they charge is often regulated by government as well. Sometimes market power is the result of network effects or synergies that make it very difficult to compete with a company once it has reached a critical level of market penetration. EBay gained such a large share of the online auction market that its information on buyers and sellers and the number of buyers who visit eBay essentially precluded others from establishing competing businesses. While it may have competition to some degree, its market share is such that it has negatively sloped demand and a good deal of pricing power. Sometimes we refer to such companies as having a moat around them that protects them from competition. It is best to remember, however, that changes in technology and consumer tastes can, and usually do, reduce market power over time.

A firm is legally insolvent if the value of its assets is less than the value of its liabilities. A firm is bankrupt if it is unable to pay its debts and files a bankruptcy petition.Solvency is measured with a liquidity ration called the \"current ratio,\" a comparison between current assets (including cash on hand and any assets that could be converted into cash within 12 months such as inventory, receivables and supplies) and current liabilities (debts that are due within the next 12 months, such as interest and principal payments on debt serviced, payroll and payroll taxes). There are many ways to interpret the current ratio. For example, the textbook \"Contemporary Financial Management\" considers a 2:1 current ratio as solvent, showing that the firm's current assets are twice its current liabilities. In other words, the firm's assets would cover its current liabilities about two times. When a public company is unable to meet its debt obligations and files for protection under bankruptcy, it can reorganize its business in an attempt to become profitable, or it can close its operations, sell off its assets and use the proceeds to pay off its debts (a process called \"liquidation\").

B Members and candidates are required to cooperate with PCP investigations into their own conduct and encouraged to cooperate with PCP investigations into the conduct of others. Sharing confidential information with the PCP is not a violation of Standard III(E) Preservation of Confidentiality. Any client information shared with the PCP will be kept in strict confidence. Standard III(E) states that members and candidates are required to maintain confidentiality of client records even after the end of the client relationship. 12. C According to Standard IV(A) Loyalty, members and candidates are expected to act for the benefit of their employer and not deprive the employer of their skills. Fletcher is performing work similar to the services that her employer provides. Although the position is a volunteer position, Fletcher will receive compensation in the form of a free parking space. In light of the circumstances, Fletcher must disclose the details of the position to her employer and get written permission before accepting the volunteer position. 13. B Johnson should disclose her additional compensation arrangement in writing to her employer and obtain her employer's written consent before accepting this offer, in accordance with Standard IV(B) Additional Compensation Arrangements. 14. B Members or candidates may delegate supervisory duties to subordinates but remain responsible for instructing them about how to detect and prevent violations. Reporting the violation and warning the employee are not sufficient to comply with Standard IV(C) Responsibilities of Supervisors. The supervisor must also take steps to prevent further violations while she conducts an investigation, such as limiting the employee's activity or increasing her monitoring of the employee. Supervisors should enforce investment-related and non-investment related policies equally. 15.

Firms differentiate their products through features and marketing with claims of more attractiveness, whiter teeth, fresher breath, and even of actually cleaning your teeth and preventing decay. If the price of your personal favorite increases, you are not likely to immediately switch to another brand as under perfect competition. Some customers would switch in response to a 10% increase in price and some would not. This is why firm demand is downward sloping. The most important characteristic of an oligopoly market is that there are only a few firms competing. In such a market, each firm must consider the actions and responses of other firms in setting price and business strategy. We say that such firms are interdependent. While products are typically good substitutes for each other, they may be either quite similar or differentiated through features, branding, marketing, and quality. Barriers to entry are high, often because economies of scale in production or marketing lead to very large firms. Demand can be more or less elastic than for firms in monopolistic competition. The automobile market is dominated by a few very large firms and can be characterized as an oligopoly. The product and pricing decisions of Toyota certainly affect those of Ford and vice versa. Automobile makers compete based on price, but also through marketing, product features, and quality, which is often signaled strongly through brand name. The oil industry also has a few dominant firms but their products are very good substitutes for each other. A monopoly market is characterized by a single seller of a product with no close substitutes. This fact alone means that the firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve (the market demand curve) and has the power to choose the price at which it sells its product. High barriers to entry protect a monopoly producer from competition. One source of monopoly power is the protection offered by copyrights and patents. Another possible source of monopoly power is control over a resource specifically needed to produce the product. Most frequently, monopoly power is supported by government. A natural monopoly refers to a situation where the average cost of production is falling over the relevant range of consumer demand. In this case, having two (or more) producers would result in a significantly higher cost of production and be detrimental to consumers. Examples of natural monopolies include the electric power and distribution business and other public utilities. When privately owned companies are granted such monopoly power, the price they charge is often regulated by government as well. Sometimes market power is the result of network effects or synergies that make it very difficult to compete with a company once it has reached a critical level of market penetration. EBay gained such a large share of the online auction market that its information on buyers and sellers and the number of buyers who visit eBay essentially precluded others from establishing competing businesses. While it may have competition to some degree, its market share is such that it has negatively sloped demand and a good deal of pricing power. Sometimes we refer to such companies as having a moat around them that protects them from competition. It is best to remember, however, that changes in technology and consumer tastes can, and usually do, reduce market power over time.

We are essentially finding the consumption bundle that the consumer would prefer at the new relative prices if his utility were unchanged (i.e., the new bundle must be on I. The substitution effect of the decrease in the price of Good X is always positive and is shown as the increase in the quantity of X from Q, to Qs. The income effect is shown as the change in consumption from T, to the new tangency point T, (most preferred bundle) of indifference curve I, and the new budget line B\u012e, and the change in quantity from Qs to Qi. In Panel (a), both the income and substitution effects increase consumption of Good X. In Panel (b), the income effect is negative but smaller in magnitude than the substitution effect, so the total effect of the price reduction on the consumption of Good X is still positive, an increase from Q, to Q. In Panel (c), the negative income effect is larger than the substitution effect, and the total effect of the reduction in the price of Good X is a decrease in the quantity of X from Q, to Q\u0131.

A Buying a put is most similar to a short position in the underlying asset because the put increases in value if the underlying asset value decreases. The writer of a put and the holder of a call have a long exposure to the underlying asset because their positions increase in value if the underlying asset value increases. 4. B The total purchase price is 1,000 x $50 = $50,000. The investor must post initial margin of 40% x $50,000 = $20,000. The remaining $30,000 is borrowed. The commission on the purchase is 1,000 x $0.01 = $10. Thus, the initial equity investment is $20,010. In one year, the sales price is 1,000 x $56 = $56,000. Dividends received are 1,000 x $0.30 = $300. Interest paid is $30,000 x 3% = $900. The commission on the sale is 1,000 x $0.01 = $10. Thus the ending value is $56,000 - $30,000 + $300 - $900 - $10 = $25,390. The return on the equity investment is $25,390 / $20,010 - 1 = 26.89%. 5.
