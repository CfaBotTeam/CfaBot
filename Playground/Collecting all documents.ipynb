       "\"An empirical probability is established by analyzing past data. An a priori probability is determined using a formal reasoning and inspection process. A subjective probability is the least formal method of developing probabilities and involves the use of personal judgment. An analyst may know many things about a firm's performance and have expectations about the overall market that are all used to arrive at a subjective probability, such as, “I believe there is a 70% probability that Acme Foods will outperform the market this year.” Empirical and a priori probabilities, by contrast, are objective probabilities. \""
