        <question>2. Ross Nelson, CFA, manages accounts for high-net-worth clients, including his own family's account. He has no beneficial ownership in his family's account. Because Nelson is concerned about the appearance of improper behavior in managing his family's account, when his firm purchases a block of securities, Nelson allocates to his family's account only those shares that remain after his other client accounts have their orders filled. The fee for managing his family's account is based on his firm's normal fee structure. According to the Standards of Practice Handbook, Nelson's best course of action with regard to management of his family's account would be to:</question>

        <question>25. Use the following values from a student's t-distribution to establish a 95% confidence interval for the population mean given a sample size of 10, a sample mean of 6.25, and a sample standard deviation of 12. Assume that the population from which the sample is drawn is normally distributed and the population variance is not known. Degrees of Freedom p = 0.10 p = 0.05 p = 0.025 p = 0.01 1.383 1.833 2.262 2.821 10 1.372 1.812 2.228 2.764 11 1.363 1.796 2.201 2.718 The 95% confidence interval is closest to a:</question>

        </choices>
        <answer>B</answer>
        <comments>With a sample size of 10, there are 9 degrees of freedom. The confidence interval concept is based on a two-tailed approach. For a 95% confidence interval, 2.5% of the distribution will be in each tail. Thus, the correct t-statistic to use is 2.262. The confidence interval is calculated as: X + t 0.025 s/vn where X is the sample mean, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size. In this case: 6.25 + 2.262 x 12/V10 = 6.254 8.58369 or-2.33 to 14.83. CFA Level I. "Sampling and Estimation," Richard A. DeFusco, Dennis W. McLeavey, Jerald E. Pinto, and David E.

However, unexpected problems during the first year have caused engineers to suggest that a more expensive design may be required, costing up to $8 million more.

        <comments>U.S. GAAP requires that long term contracts whose outcomes can be reliably measured should be accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method, based on the stage of completion. Under the original assumptions, the company would have recognized $15 million of revenue. Calculations Under the Percentage-of-Completion Method Costs incurred to date $12 million Estimated total costs $32 million % total costs incurred to date 37.5% Total contract revenue $40 million % revenue to be recognized 37.5% Current year revenue $15 million Now that the company is unclear on the appropriate design and thus the cost, the outcome cannot be reliably measured. The completed contract method is used. Under this approach, no revenue ($ 0) is recognized until the contract is substantially complete.

        <comments>Whether the company sells or leases the asset, inventory will be reduced. For sales, the company would report an accounts receivable classified as a current asset (assuming sales terms are not in question). If the leases qualify as finance leases, then the company will report a lease receivable, which is primarily long term. Therefore, compared with selling units outright, the company's current assets are lower under leasing and its liquidity position will decrease.

The higher reported net income also increases retained earnings and thus results in a lower debt-to-equity ratio, not a higher one. The combination of higher inventory and lower cost of goods sold (CGS) decreases inventory turnover (CGS/Inventory). CFA Level I "Inventories," Michael A.

        <question>68. The following excerpt was taken from the notes of a company's financial statements that were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. All figures are in thousands of Australian dollars. Note 12: Broadcast Licenses During 2014, the company successfully disposed of broadcast licenses that were held for sale for A$37,900 (net book value of A$23,500). Based on the successful completion of that sale, the impairment losses taken in 2012 on other licenses have been reversed, restoring those intangible assets to their amortized historical cost. Broadcast licenses are amortized over a period of 15‚Äì25 years. The note leads an analyst to believe that the rapid reversal of the impairment loss related to the broadcast licenses arose as an attempt by management to manage earnings. If the analyst's belief is correct, her analysis of the original 2013 financial statements would most likely have shown that, compared with the economic reality in 2013, the company had:</question>

        <answer>C</answer>
        <comments>The broadcast licenses were written down in 2012, but the write-down was reversed in 2014. Therefore, during 2013 the intangible assets were understated, which would have understated amortization expense for the year and increased profit. Thus, in 2013 net profit margin was overstated.

This calculation can be done with a financial calculator: FV = -$1,000, PV = $1,105.94, N = 20, PMT = -$80, solve for i, which will equal 7%. The bond-yield-plus-risk-premium approach is calculated by adding a risk premium to the cost of debt (i.e., the yield to maturity for the debt), making the cost of equity 12.00% (= 7% +5%).
