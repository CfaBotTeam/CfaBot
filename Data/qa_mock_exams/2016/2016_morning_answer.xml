        <comments>Under Standard III ( B ) - Fair Dealing, members and candidates should disclose to clients and prospective clients how they select accounts to participate in and how they determine the amount of securities each account will buy or sell. Trade allocation procedures must be fair and equitable, and disclosure of inequitable allocation methods does not relieve the member or candidate of this obligation. All discretionary accounts should be treated in the same manner. Treating newer accounts differently would be considered inequitable regardless of whether this policy is disclosed.

Given that the values between $ 36 million and $ 48 million are equally likely, the probability of the ratio being equal to or less than 2. 0 is 33. 3 % ( = [ $ 40 million – $ 36 million ] / [ $ 48 million – $ 36 million ] ). Consequently, the probability of the ratio being greater than 2. 0 is 66. 7 % ( i. e., 1 - Probability of the ratio being equal to or less than 2. 0 ).

Correct answer : B . Across two periods , there are four possibilities : an up move followed by an up move ( $ 121 . 00 end value ) , an up move followed by a down move ( $ 101 . 20 end value ) , a down move followed by an up move ( $ 101 . 20 end value ) , and a down move followed by a down move ( $ 84 . 64 end value ) . The probability of an up move followed by a down move is 0 . 40 x 0 . 60 = 0 . 24 . The probability of a down move followed by an up move is 0 . 60 x0 . 40 , which also = 0 . 24 . Both of these sequences result in an end value of $ 101 . 20 . Therefore , the probability of an end value of $ 101 . 20 is 48 % . Alternatively , the following formula could be used : n - X p ( x ) = p ( x = x ) = h ! ( n – x ) ! x ! P p * ( 1 - p ) * ( Equation 1 ) Where n = 2 ( number of periods ) X = 1 ( number of up moves: ud and du ) p = 0. 40 ( probability of an up move ) 2 plı ) = ( o. 10 ' ( 1 – 0. 40 ) " - * 0. 40 ' x 0. 6 ' = 2 * 0. 40 x 0. 60 = 0. 48 x 0. 401 x 0. 6 = 2 x 0. 40 x 0. 60 = 0. 48 CFA Level I “ Common Probability Distributions, ” Richard A.

        <comments>Whether the company sells or leases the asset, inventory will be reduced. For sales, the company would report an accounts receivable classified as a current asset ( assuming sales terms are not in question ). If the leases qualify as finance leases, then the company will report a lease receivable, which is primarily long term. Therefore, compared with selling units outright, the company ' s current assets are lower under leasing and its liquidity position will decrease.

        <comments>An organization with a strong competitive position can recover from losses more easily than one with a weaker competitive positive. Therefore an organization ' s risk tolerance should reflect its competitive position. An organization ' s size does not define the risks sources it faces or the relative losses it can absorb; therefore it should not be reflected in its risk tolerance. Neither the risk sources affecting an organization nor the size of the losses an organization can absorb are a function of its perception of market stability.
