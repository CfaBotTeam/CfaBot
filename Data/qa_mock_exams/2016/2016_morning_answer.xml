All discretionary accounts should be treated in the same manner. Treating neweraccounts differently would be considered inequitable regardless of whether this policy isdisclosed.CFA Level I"Guidance for Standards I-VII," CFA InstituteStandard III(B)</comments>

Given that the valuesbetween $36 million and $48 million are equally likely, the probability of the ratio being equal toor less than 2.0 is 33.3% (= [$40 million – $36 million]/[$48 million – $36 million]).Consequently, the probability of the ratio being greater than 2.0 is 66.7% (i.e., 1- Probability ofthe ratio being equal to or less than 2.0).CFA Level I"Common Probability Distributions," Richard A.

McLeavey, Jerald E. Pinto, and David E.RunkleSection 223. Correct answer: B.Across two periods, there are four possibilities: an up move followed by an up move ($121.00 endvalue), an up move followed by a down move ($101.20 end value), a down move followed by anup move ($101.20 end value), and a down move followed by a down move ($84.64 end value).The probability of an up move followed by a down move is 0.40 x 0.60 = 0.24. The probability ofa down move followed by an up move is 0.60 x0.40, which also = 0.24. Both of these sequencesresult in an end value of $101.20. Therefore, the probability of an end value of $101.20 is 48%.Alternatively, the following formula could be used:n-Xp(x) = p(x = x) = h!(n – x) !x!P p* (1 - p) * (Equation 1)Wheren = 2 (number of periods)X=1 (number of up moves: ud and du)p = 0.40 (probability of an up move)2plı) = (o. 10'(1 – 0. 40)" -* 0. 40' x 0.6' = 2 * 0. 40 x 0.60 = 0.48x 0. 401 x 0. 6= 2 x 0. 40 x 0. 60 = 0. 48CFA Level I“Common Probability Distributions,” Richard A.

The completed contract method is used. Under this approach, no revenue($ 0) is recognized until the contract is substantially complete.

Correct answer: A.Common size statements offer a convenient way to compare companies of different magnitudes.Company X reports better (higher) gross margin performance. Company Y reports better (higher)operating margin performance.Metric (common size)Company XCompany YComparisonSales100%100%Cost of goods sold5153Gross margin (GM)4947X's GM is higherAdministrative costs17.15Research &amp; development expenses1312Operating margin (OM)1920Y’s OM is higherCFA Level I"Understanding Income Statements," Elaine Henry and Thomas R. RobinsonSection 7.146. Correct answer: A.U.S. GAAP requires that long term contracts whose outcomes can be reliably measured should beaccounted for using the percentage-of-completion method, based on the stage of completion.Under the original assumptions, the company would have recognized $15 million of revenue.Calculations Under the Percentage-of-Completion MethodCosts incurred to date$12 millionEstimated total costs$32 million% total costs incurred to date37.5%Total contract revenue$40 million% revenue to be recognized37.5%Current year revenue$15 millionNow that the company is unclear on the appropriate design and thus the cost, the outcome cannotbe reliably measured. The completed contract method is used. Under this approach, no revenue($ 0) is recognized until the contract is substantially complete. The difference in reported revenueunder the two methods is: $15 million - $0 = $15 million.CFA Level I"Understanding Income Statements," Elaine Henry and Thomas R. RobinsonSection 3.2.1</comments>

        <comments>Whether the company sells or leases the asset, inventory will be reduced. For sales, the companywould report an accounts receivable classified as a current asset (assuming sales terms are not inquestion). If the leases qualify as finance leases, then the company will report a lease receivable,which is primarily long term. Therefore, compared with selling units outright, the company'scurrent assets are lower under leasing and its liquidity position will decrease.CFA Level I"Long-Lived Assets," Elaine Henry and Elizabeth A.
