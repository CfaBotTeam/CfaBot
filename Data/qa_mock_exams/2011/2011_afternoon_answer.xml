	<question>4. Florence Zuelekha, CFA, is an equity portfolio manager at Grid Equity Management (GEM), a firm specializing in commodities. Zuelekha, who previously focused on alternative energy, recently attends her first commodity conference, sponsored in large part by GEM. Independent industry experts, argued commodities would increase in value and recommended investors hold at least 10% of their portfolio assets in commodities based on consistent increases in their values over the previous two years. Without doing any additional research, Zuelekha recommends to all her clients an immediate allocation of 5% of their portfolio into commodities.

C is correct, as Standard (V) requires members and candidates to have a reasonable and adequate basis, supported by appropriate research and investigation, for any investment analysis, recommendation, or action. Relying solely upon attendance at a one-day conference listening to industry experts to make an investment recommendation, especially when the industry experts have based their recommendations upon price data only, would not meet the requirements of the Code and Standard with regard to Diligence and a Reasonable Basis.</comments>

A long time OA employee, Derek Longtree, recently changed the asset allocation of a client, which is inconsistent with her financial needs and objectives and with OA&apos;s policies. Until now Longtree has never violated OA&apos;s policies. Tasha discusses the issue with Longtree but takes no further action. Do Tasha&apos;s actions concerning Longtree most likely violate any CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct?	</question>

C is correct.. Once a supervisor learns that an employee has violated or may have violated the law or the Code and Standards, the supervisor must promptly initiate an investigation to ascertain the extent of the wrongdoing. Relying on an employee&apos;s statements about the extent of the violation or assurances that the wrongdoing will not recur is not enough. Reporting the misconduct up the chain of command and warning the employee to cease the activity are also not enough. Pending the outcome of the investigation, a supervisor should take steps to ensure that the violation will not be repeated, such as placing limits on the employee&apos;s activities or increasing the monitoring of the employee&apos;s activities.

	<question>6. Wang Dazong, CFA, is a sole proprietor investment advisor. Dazong believes in putting his money at risk along with his clients and trades the same securities as his clients. In order to ensure fair treatment of all accounts, he rotates trade allocations so that each account has an equal likelihood of receiving a fill on their orders. This allocation procedure also applies to Dazong&apos;s own account. According to the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct, the allocation procedure used by Dazong:	</question>

B is correct because Standard VI (B) requires client transactions to be given precedence over transactions made on behalf of the members or candidate&apos;s firm or personal transactions. Because the advisor trades alongside his clients and allocates trades on a rotating basis, there are times when the advisor&apos;s trades will receive priority over his clients in violation of the Code and Standards. A member or candidate having the same investment positions or being co¬ invested with clients does not always create a conflict. Some clients in certain investment situations require members or candidates to have aligned interests. Personal investment positions or transactions of members or candidates or their firms should never, however, adversely affect client investments.</comments>

	<question>8. Kazuya Kato, CFA, is a widely followed economist at a global investment bank. When Kato opines on economic trends, markets react by moving stock valuations considerably. When Kato receives information of a temporary oversupply of rare earth metals, he issues a forecast that price trends for rare earth metals will be down significantly on a long-term basis. Kato also secretly sells his report to a widely followed Internet site. Prior to issuing this forecast, Kato emailed all portfolio managers at his bank with a copy of his report indicating that his opinion would be reversed shortly so there will be trading opportunities.

	<question>11. Praful Chandarana, CFA, is starting a new business to offer investment-consulting services to pension fund trustees in response to a new regulation that requires all pension fund Investment Policy Statements (IPS) to be reviewed and approved by an independent CFA Charterholder. Prior to starting the new business, he meets with the pension fund regulator to clarify if the CFA Charterholder undertaking the IPS review should be a licensed financial advisor. A separate regulatory body grants the license to those giving investment advice to clients. The regulator states they do not require the CFA Charterholder to hold a financial advisor&apos;s license, despite financial-related advice being given to the pension funds during any IPS review. Chandarana therefore, starts his new business to undertake IPS reviews without obtaining a financial advisors license. Subsequently when clients of his former employer contact him he informs them of his new company and the services he offers. Does Chandarana most likely violate the CFA Code and Standards?	</question>

B is correct because the CFA Code of Ethics requires Chandarana to uphold the rules governing financial advisors. However, he failed to do so because he did not obtain a financial advisors license. The CFA Standards of Professional Conduct (I(A) - Professionalism - Knowledge of the Law) states that when rules or regulations are in conflict, Members must comply with the more strict law, in this case the requirement for financial advisors to be licensed.</comments>

By not communicating to prospective clients the change in the investment process through the delay in the creation of new marketing material however Cherogony violates Standard V (B) - Communication with Clients which requires Members and Candidates to disclose to clients and prospective clients the basic format and general principles of the investment processes they use to analyze investments, select securities and construct portfolios and must promptly disclose any changes that might materially affect those processes.

	<question>18. Meshack Bradovic, CFA, was recently hired as a credit analyst at a credit rating agency whose major clients include publicly listed companies on the local stock exchange. One of the clients is currently preparing to issue a new bond to finance a major factory project. Analysts are speculating that without the new factory the company will not survive the onslaught of competition from increasing imports; therefore, the company is counting on an upgraded credit rating to enhance the subscription level of the issue. Bradovic&apos;s research suggests the creditworthiness of the company has severely deteriorated over the last year due to negative operating cash flows. Without conducting extensive research, Bradovic&apos;s boss puts pressure on him to upgrade the credit rating to an investment grade rating. What course of action is most appropriate for Bradovic to prevent any violation of the CFA Code or Standards?	</question>

A is correct as the boss&apos; insistence that all credit ratings be given an investment grade rating irrespective of the analysis undertaken indicates a systemic disregard for due diligence, reasonable basis and true representation. This shows a total disregard for the CFA Standards. Bradovic&apos;s best course of action consequently is to resign, as the company&apos;s current practice of giving false credit ratings is likely to continue.

The different treatment for tax purposes and financial reporting purposes is a temporary difference and would create a deferred tax liability. Deferred tax liabilities should be classified as debt if they are expected to reverse with subsequent tax payments. The long history of profitability implies the company will likely be paying taxes in the following years and hence an analyst could reasonably expect the temporary difference to reverse. Under IFRS all deferred tax liabilities are non-current and therefore do not affect the current ratio.</comments>

Calculate and interpret the cost of equity capital using the capital asset pricing model approach, the dividend discount model approach, and the bond-yield-plus-risk-premium approach. First, you need to determine the yield-to-maturity, which is the discount rate that sets the bond price to $1,105.94 and is equal to 7%. This can be done with a financial calculator: FV = -1,000, PV = 1,105.94, N = 20, PMT = -80, solve for I, which will equal 7%. The bond-yield-plus-risk-premium approach is calculated by adding a risk premium to the cost of debt (i.e. the yield-to-maturity for the debt) making the cost of equity 12.00% (= 7% +5%).</comments>

Calculate and interpret the operating breakeven quantity of sales. When DFL (= operating income 4 net income) = 1.00, operating income = net income, meaning the fixed cost of debt is zero. The breakeven point is: (fixed costs + fixed cost of debt) 4 contribution margin. Because the fixed cost of debt is zero, the company&apos;s breakeven point becomes: fixed costs 4 contribution margin, which is the same as the operating breakeven point.</comments>

Calculate and compare the effects of a share repurchase on earnings per share when 1) the repurchase is financed with the company&apos;s excess cash and 2) the company uses funded debt to finance the repurchase. The pre-repurchase EPS is EAT / 20 million. The EPS after the repurchase is (EAT x (1- 20%) / 15 million). To connect the two values algebraically: (EAT / 20 million) x X = (EAT x (1- 20%) / 15 million) X = (1 - 20%) x (20 million / 15 million) = 1.067 Because X is greater than one, the EPS has increased after the repurchase.</comments>

Explain asset-based valuation models and demonstrate the use of asset-base models to calculate equity value. Free-cash-flow-to-equity (FCFE) is a measure of the firm&apos;s dividend-paying capacity which should be reflected in the cash flow estimates rather than expected dividends. Analysts must make projections of financials to forecast future FCFE and thus the constant growth assumption as in the Gordon growth model is not an issue.
