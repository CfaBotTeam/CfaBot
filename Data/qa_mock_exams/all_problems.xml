The total consumer surplus is the consumer surplus on each mango that Reddy buys and added together. It is the area of  the right triangle = (base x height) / 2 as in Figure 3 on p. 40, with base equal to 20 mangoes a week and the height equal  to 6, the consumer surplus on each mango. Thus the total consumer surplus = (20 x 6) / 2 = Rs.60 (see example on p. 41). </comments>

It  would have been deducted in the calculation of net income but the loss is not the cash impact of the transaction (the  proceeds received, if any, would be the cash effect) and cash flows related to equipment transactions are investing  activities, not operating activities.)  CFO = 45.8 + 18.2 + 1.6 + 4.2 - 3.4 + 2.5 = $68.9 million  $68.9 - $7.3 = $61.6 million free cash flow to equity.  </comments>

(n = 5, I = 12%, PMT = $100,000)  12% of the original PV is $43,257.31 and represents the interest component of the payment in the first year. The  difference between the annual payment and the interest is the amortization of the lease obligation and is included in cash  flow from financing. $100,000 - 43,257.31 = $56,742.69.  Depreciation is $360,477.62 / 5 or $72,095.52, so the total reduction in pretax income would be interest plus depreciation  or $115,352.83. Cash flow from operations would be reduced by the amount of the interest only because the depreciation  would be added back to determine cash flow from operations.     </comments>

Without a change in the LIFO reserve, cost of goods sold would be the  same under both methods. Sales are always the same for both, so gross profit margin would be the same in 2007. The FIFO  inventory would be higher because the LIFO inventory and LIFO reserve are added to compute FIFO inventory. Because the  inventory balances would be different under FIFO, the current ratio, inventory turnover, and net working capital would also be  different under FIFO.   </comments>

The price of a putable bond will  increase because the price of the putable bond is equal to an option-free bond plus the put option.    </comments>

A zero-coupon bond has no reinvestment risk since no cash flows are received that must be  reinvested before maturity. Because zero-coupon bonds do not have periodic cash flows, they have the highest interest rate risk  for a given maturity and a given change in market yields.    </comments>

In addition, the Candidate most likely violated Standard I(B)- Professionalism-Independence and Objectivity in that every member or candidate should endeavor to avoid situations that could cause or be perceived to cause a loss of independence or objectivity in recommending investments or taking investment action. By not disclosing the fact that the Candidate is a shareholder and related to the Managing Director of the oil company she could be perceived to be in a position of a conflict of interest and one where she has a loss of independence and objectivity.</comments>

Therefore the debt- to-equity ratio will be lower, for the bonds with warrants. EBIT would be the same regardless of financing method; the coupon on the bond with warrants attached would be lower if the two issues provided the same proceeds, so the interest coverage would be higher for a bond with warrants attached.

A callable bond’s value is equal to an option-free bond less the value of the call option. As interest rates rise, the value of the call option decreases by a decreasing amount relative to the straight bond. The option-free bond also declines in value as interest rates rise, but this is offset by the decline in the value of the call option.

(Current ratio is higher than quick ratio and quick ratio is higher than cash ratio.) The quick ratio includes accounts receivable but the cash ratio does not. The denominator for all three ratios is current liabilities, which are the same proportion for both companies. The difference in ratios is therefore created by inventory and accounts receivable.

Calculate, classify, and interpret activity, liquidity, solvency, profitability, and valuation ratios. The repayment of short-term debt would reduce cash flow from financing, not cash flow from operations. Any time the current ratio is above 1, equal changes in a current asset and a current liability will result in an increase in the current ratio: if current assets = 550 and current liabilities are 275, current ratio = 550/275 = 2.0. After the bank borrowing has been paid, the ratio becomes (550-150)/(275-150) = 3.2. Had the ratio initially been below 1, current assets = 250 and current liabilities are 275, current ratio = 250/275 = 0.91, the equal change in current assets and liabilities would decrease the current ratio: 100/125=0.80. </comments>

The book value of the equipment at the time of sale is $110,000 - $70,000 = $40,000. The proceeds are $30,000; therefore a loss of $10,000 is reported on the income statement. The loss reduces net income, but it is a non-cash amount, so is added back to net income in the calculation of the cash from operations. Therefore, cash from operations is higher than net income, not lower. The total amount of the proceeds, $30,000, is the cash inflow from the transaction and is shown as a cash inflow from investing activities. </comments>

Free cash flow to equity in a company without any debt is equal to cash flow from operations (CFO) less capital expenditures. CFO = net income + depreciation + loss on sale of equipment + decrease in accounts receivable - increase in inventories + increase in accounts payable. (The loss on sale of equipment is added back when calculating CFO. It would have been deducted in the calculation of net income but the loss is not the cash impact of the transaction (the proceeds received, if any, would be the cash effect) and cash flows related to equipment transactions are investing activities, not operating activities.

Broihahn, CFA 2009 Modular Level I, Volume 3, pp. 171-173 Study Session 8-32-h Describe the components of earnings per share and calculate a company’s earnings per share (both basic and diluted earnings per share) for both a simple and complex capital structure. Diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method that considers what would be the effect if the options or warrants had been exercised. Only options or warrants that are in-the-money are included, as out-of-the-money options would not be exercised. Therefore only the warrants are dilutive: their exercise price is below the average market price of the stock. Using the treasury stock method, the number of new shares issued on exercise is reduced by the number of shares that could be purchased with the cash received upon exercise of the warrants: 20,000($30) = $600,000 in proceeds. $600,000 / $40 = 15,000 shares treasury stock. Incremental shares using the treasury stock method = 20,000 - 15,000 = 5,000. </comments>

The present value of the lease is $360,477.62. (n = 5, I = 12%, PMT = $100,000) 12% of the original PV is $43,257.31 and represents the interest component of the payment in the first year. The difference between the annual payment and the interest is the amortization of the lease obligation included in cash flow from financing. $100,000 - 43,257.31 = $56,742.69. Depreciation is $360,477.62 / 5 or $72,095.52 so the total reduction in pretax income would be interest plus depreciation or $115,352.83. Cash flow from operations would be reduced by the amount of the interest only because the depreciation would be added back to determine cash flow from operations. </comments>

Given that sales are normally distributed, the mean is centered in the interval. Mean = ($230,000 + 480,000) / 2 = $355,000. 99 percent of observations under a normal distribution will be plus/minus three standard deviations. Thus, ($355,000 - $230,000)/3.0 = $41,667.

A permanent decrease in demand in a perfectly competitive industry will, in the short-run, cause the demand curve to shift to the left causing prices to fall and creating losses for producers. As the fall in demand is permanent, eventually firms will leave the industry due to these economic losses. As firms leave the industry the supply curve moves to the right thus increasing prices back to an equilibrium where economic profit is zero.</comments>

Describe board independence and explain the importance of independent board members in corporate governance. If the chair of the board is a former chief executive of the company, it may hamper efforts to undo the mistakes made by him or her as chief executive. It is not clear if it is better to have all members elected annually (more flexibility to meet changes in the marketplace) or if it is better to have staggered board terms (better continuity of board expertise). All members of the audit committee should be independent members of the board.</comments>

Crux traded on the material information that Orca is about to be acquired by Cyber Kinetics. The information is non-public because it is not publicly available, which was verified when Crux researched Orca on the Internet and found nothing about the acquisition. Standard II (A).</comments>

Explain the relationship between normal and lognormal distributions and why the lognormal distribution is used to model asset prices. The lognormal distribution is bounded by zero and thus skewed to the right. The lognormal distribution is a good fit to stock prices as stock prices can not fall below zero.

Determine the profit maximizing (loss minimizing) output for a perfectly competitive company and explain marginal cost, marginal revenue, and economic profit and loss. Marginal cost, in the short-run, decreases at low level of outputs due to economies from greater specialization. However, at higher levels of production, it eventually increases because of the law of diminishing returns.</comments>

Under U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets must be assessed at each balance sheet date. If there is any doubt whether the deferral will be recovered, the carrying amount should be reduced to the expected recoverable amount. The asset is reduced by increasing the valuation allowance. Should circumstances change, so that it is more probable that the deferred tax benefits will be recovered, the deferred asset account will be increased (and the valuation allowance decreased). An increase in the carry forward period for tax losses extends the possibility that benefits will be realized from the deferred tax asset and would likely result in a decrease in the valuation allowance and an increase in the deferred tax asset.</comments>

McLeavey, CFA 2010 Modular Level I, Vol. 5, p. 198-200 Study Session 14-56-d; 14-59-b Show how to use the DDM to develop an earnings multiplier model and explain the factors in the DDM that affect a stock’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Calculate and interpret P/E, P/BV, P/S, and P/CF. The trailing P/E ratio is computed as the current stock price divided by the current or trailing 12-months’ EPS. On the other hand, the P/E ratio based on the infinite period dividend discount model is computed as (D/E) / (k - g). If markets are in equilibrium, the price per share reflects the value determined by the constant growth dividend. Using the constant growth model the stock's value is ($2.40)(1.08) / 0.07 = $37.03; The trailing P/E = 37.03 / 6 = 6.17. The DDM P/E is the dividend payout ratio divided by k-g = 0.4 / 0.07 = 5.71. Another way of computing DDM P/E is: Current Market Price/Expected 12-month earnings: 37.03/(6.00 x 1.08) = 5.71. (see p. 148)</comments>

These are known as moral obligation bonds. They are a form of general obligation debt, but most general obligation debt does not include such a pledge. In contrast, a prerefunded bond is backed by a trust of riskless securities that provide cash flows sufficient to pay the interest and principal payments of the bond.</comments>

Survivorship bias affects both the returns and the risk (standard deviation) reported for the hedge funds. Hedge funds with low or negative returns will be excluded from the index as will funds with high volatility; those funds will not survive for eight years.

C is correct.. Once a supervisor learns that an employee has violated or may have violated the law or the Code and Standards, the supervisor must promptly initiate an investigation to ascertain the extent of the wrongdoing. Relying on an employee's statements about the extent of the violation or assurances that the wrongdoing will not recur is not enough. Reporting the misconduct up the chain of command and warning the employee to cease the activity are also not enough. Pending the outcome of the investigation, a supervisor should take steps to ensure that the violation will not be repeated, such as placing limits on the employee's activities or increasing the monitoring of the employee's activities. </comments>

B is correct because Standard VI (B) requires client transactions to be given precedence over transactions made on behalf of the members or candidate's firm or personal transactions. Because the advisor trades alongside his clients and allocates trades on a rotating basis, there are times when the advisor's trades will receive priority over his clients in violation of the Code and Standards. A member or candidate having the same investment positions or being co¬ invested with clients does not always create a conflict. Some clients in certain investment situations require members or candidates to have aligned interests. Personal investment positions or transactions of members or candidates or their firms should never, however, adversely affect client investments.</comments>

The higher reported net income also increases retained earnings, and therefore results in a lower debt-to- equity ratio not a higher one.

Free-cash-flow-to-equity (FCFE) is a measure of the firm's dividend-paying capacity which should be reflected in the cash flow estimates rather than expected dividends. Analysts must make projections of financials to forecast future FCFE and thus the constant growth assumption as in the Gordon growth model is not an issue.

Construct a binomial tree to describe stock price movement. Across two periods, there are four possibilities: an up move followed by an up move ($121.00 end value), an up move followed by a down move ($101.20 end value), a down move followed by an up move ($101.20 end value), and a down move followed by a down move ($84.64 end value). The probability of an up move followed by a down move is 0.40 times 0.60 equals 0.24. The probability of a down move followed by an up move is 0.60 times 0.40 also equals 0.24.

        <question id="56">An equity analyst is forecasting the next year’s net profit margin of a heavy equipment manufacturing firm, by using the average net profit margin over the past three years. In making his profit projection, he is concerned about the following three items: 1. The company suffered losses from discontinued operations in each of the past three years. 2. The most recent year’s tax rate was only one half the prior two years’ rate as a result of a fiscal stimulus. 3. The company experienced gains on the sale of investments in each of the past three years. Which of the following statements about the preparation of the forecast is most accurate?

The company is a heavy equipment manufacturer - since gains on investments is not a core part of its business, they should not be viewed as an ongoing source of earnings. Discontinued operations are considered to be nonrecurring items (even though they have occurred in the past three years); they are normally treated as random and unsustainable and should not be included in a short-term forecast; the change in the current tax rate is best viewed as temporary (in the absence) of additional information and should not be the basis of the calculation of the average tax rate. </comments>

The company can choose when to enter into the short-term borrowing with the bank and reclassify its accounts payable into short-term financing. It will likely do so when cash flows are seasonally strong, thereby reducing operating cash flows but increasing financing cash flows. On repayment, the cash outflow is treated as a financing activity (loan repayment) not an operating cash flow. The result is that the company can manipulate the timing of reported cash flows since the timing and extent of vendor financing is at management’s discretion. </comments>

The underlying is the unknown interest rate. If the unknown underlying rate turns out to be higher than the exercise rate at expiration, the option is exercised.

        <question id="9">Monique Gretta, CFA, is a research analyst at East West Investment Bank. Previously, Gretta worked at a mutual fund management company and has a long-standing client relationship with the managers of the funds and their institutional investors. Gretta often provides fund managers, who work for Gretta's former employer, with draft copies of her research before disseminating the information to all of the bank's clients. This practice has helped Gretta avoid several errors in her reports, and she believes it is beneficial to the bank's clients, even though they are not aware of this practice. Regarding her research, Gretta least likely violated the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct because:</question>

Recommend practices and procedures designed to prevent violations of the Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct. C is correct because the analyst does not violate any of the Standards of Professional Conduct by having long-standing client relationships and generally is not required to disclose such relationships. However, the analyst is not treating all clients fairly as required by Standard III (B) Fair Dealing when disseminating investment recommendations; disclosure of the relationship with long-standing clients is not the issue. The analyst has advantaged some clients over others by providing advance information, and all clients do not have a fair opportunity to act on the information within the draft report. Members and candidates may differentiate their services to clients, but different levels of service must not disadvantage or negatively affect clients.</comments>

        <question id="10">Colin Caldwell, CFA, is the chief investment officer of Northwest Mutual Fund, whose investment objective is to invest in fixed income emerging market securities. Caldwell allocates the fund's assets primarily to bonds of commodity producers in emerging markets and invests in a combination of several different investments to ensure an acceptable level of risk. The allocation is clearly disclosed in all fund communications. High volatility in the commodities markets at the start of the year makes Caldwell pessimistic about returns, so he shifts the fund into emerging market and U.S. government securities, positions he maintains at the end of the year.

A is correct because the investment officer has invested in a combination of several different investments to ensure an acceptable level of risk rather than having all assets in a single investment, and he has sought a reasonable amount of diversification. However, the shift into emerging market and U.S. government securities was communicated to clients in the annual report and not on an ongoing basis, in violation of Standard V (B) Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients.

An absolute advantage in producing a good (or service) arises if one entity can produce that good at a lower cost or use fewer resources in its production than its trading partner. Even if a country does not have an absolute advantage in producing any of its goods, it can still gain from trade by exporting the goods in which it has a comparative advantage.

Demonstrate the application of the DuPont analysis of the return on equity, and calculate and interpret the effect of changes in its components. Calculate and interpret ratios used in equity analysis, credit analysis, and segment analysis. Calculate and interpret the cost of equity capital using the capital asset pricing model approach, the dividend discount model approach, and the bond-yield-plus risk-premium approach. A is correct. Sustainable growth rate = Retention ratio * ROE. The higher a company's ROE and its ability to finance itself from internally generated funds (a higher retention ratio), the greater its sustainable growth rate. In the five-factor ROE, any factor that increases ROE will increase sustainable growth: ROE = Tax burden * Interest burden * EBIT margin * Asset turnover * Leverage. . A higher tax burden ratio (Net income/Earnings before tax) implies that the company can keep a higher percentage of pretax profits; this implies a lower tax rate and a higher ROE. The interest burden ratio is earnings before tax to EBIT, and a lower ratio means that the company has higher borrowing costs (it gets to keep a lower pre-tax income from a given EBIT), implying a lower ROE and sustainable growth.</comments>

The customer list is the only identifiable intangible asset, and it should be amortized on a straight-line basis over its expected future life: $100,000 4 4 = $25,000/year. Goodwill is an unidentifiable intangible and should be tested for impairment but not amortized. All advertising and promotion costs, such as the media placements, are typically expensed. If the reputation of the company has been enhanced as the CEO suggests, this is an internally generated intangible that is not recorded on the balance sheet and is therefore not amortized. .</comments>

Leverage is below the industry average for both the debt-to-equity ratio of 40% [(20.1 + 1.6) 4 54] versus the industry average of 50% and long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 37% [20.1 4 54] versus the industry average of 40%.

The company's cost of equity is often used as a proxy for the investors' minimum required rate of return because it is the minimum expected rate of return that a company must offer its investors to purchase its shares in the primary market and to maintain its share price in the secondary market. Using the CAPM, the company's cost of equity = 3.50% + 1.80(5.25%) = 12.95%, compared with the fund manager's required rate of return of 13.60%.

        <question id="16">Prudence Charmaine, a CFA charterholder, was recently accused in writing of cheating on a professional accounting exam. She denied cheating and successfully defended herself against the allegation. As part of her defense and as evidence of her character, Charmaine stated she is a CFA charterholder and upholds the CFA institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct. On her next annual Professional Conduct Statement, Charmaine does not report this allegation to CFA institute.

C is correct because Charmaine should have reported the cheating allegation when making her annual Professional Conduct Statement. Even though she successfully defended herself against the charges and the charges were dropped, she has a responsibility to report the written complaint involving her integrity. The Code of Ethics requires CFA charterholders to practice and encourage others to practice in a professional and ethical manner that will reflect credit on themselves and the profession. .</comments>

A is correct because while Standard VI (B) Priority of Transactions is designed to prevent any potential conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest with respect to personal transactions, it does not ban employees from trading securities. A ban on all equity related securities could be excessively restrictive to employees and unnecessary if appropriate personal transaction policies and procedures are in place.</comments>

C is correct because the Standards require the disclosure of conflicts (Standard VI (A)). For Meir to understand what potential conflicts of interest employees may have with the firm and with their clients, he would need to know the outside interests of each staff member. The staff . members themselves may not know enough about the company and its clients to disclose those interests that would present a potential conflict. Therefore, it may be best to have all employees declare their outside business interests on an annual basis so Meir can make the determination as to what outside business interests need to be disclosed to clients.

Calculate and interpret total, marginal, and average product of Describe the phenomenon of diminishing marginal returns and profit-maximizing utilization level of an input. B is correct. The marginal product (MP) is the amount of additional output resulting from using one more unit of input: ATP/AL, where ATP is the change in total product and AL is the change in total labor. The marginal revenue product (MRP) is the marginal product of an input times the price of the product: MP x Price = ATP/AL x Price. In this problem, the marginal product of hiring the 5th and 6th workers (AL = 2) is 14 shirts per hour/2 workers = 7 shirts per hour/worker. With each shirt resulting in $3 of revenue, the MRP is 7 shirts per hour/worker x $3/shirt = $21 per worker.</comments>

Explain the implementation of fiscal policy and the difficulties of implementation. Determine whether a fiscal policy is expansionary or contractionary. . A is correct. Aggregate demand rises when the government increases spending by the same amount as it raises taxes because the marginal propensity to spend out of disposable income is less than 1, and hence for every dollar less in disposable income, spending only falls by c (where c is the marginal propensity to consume in dollars). Aggregate spending will fall less than the tax rise by a factor c. This additional output will, in turn, lead to further increases in income and output through the multiplier effect.</comments>

With no foreign sector, the GDP identity is Y = C + I + G. With substitution from the equations above, Y = 2,500 + 0.80 x (Y - T) + 500 + 0.30 x Y - 25 x r + 1,000 = 2,500 + 0.80 x (Y +250 - 0.30 x Y) + 500 + 0.30 x Y - 25 x r + 1,000.

C is correct. Export subsidies interfere with the functioning of the free market and result in a deadweight loss to society.

Explain effects of industry concentration, ease of entry, and capacity on return on invested capital and pricing power. Describe the principles of strategic analysis of an industry. A is correct. The economic profit (the spread between the return on invested capital and the cost of capital) tends to be larger in industries with differentiated products, greater pricing power, and high switching costs to customers. Industry 1 has these features. Firms in Industry 2, on the other hand, have little pricing power (undifferentiated products and rapid shifts in market shares indicating intense rivalry), which is indicative of potentially smaller economic profits. .</comments>

Therefore, the portfolio manager will receive a cash flow from the swap dealer. Value index payment = ((5350/5460) - 1) x $50,000,000 = -$1,007,326.

B is correct because a key motivation for a corporation to establish a special purpose vehicle (SPV) is to separate it as a legal entity. In the case of bankruptcy for the corporation, the SPV is unaffected because it is not a subsidiary of the corporation.

A is correct because soliciting the bank's client did not violate Standard IV (A) Loyalty because the manager is no longer an employee of the bank and there is no indication she obtained the client information from bank sources. The member, however, has violated Standard V (C) Record Retention because when she left the bank, she took the property of the bank without express permission to do so. In addition, the analyst violated Standard I (C) Misrepresentation by creating research materials without attribution, which is demonstrated when the manager adds to the new report a real estate study she saw in the Wall Street Journal, referencing the Journal only. In all instances, a member or candidate must cite the actual source of the information. If she does not obtain the report and review the information, the manager runs the risk of relying on second-hand information that may misstate facts. Best practice would be either to obtain the complete study from its original author and cite only that author or to use the information provided by the intermediary and cite both sources.</comments>

        <question id="5">Tonya Tucker, CFA, is a financial analyst at Bowron Consolidated. Bowron has numerous subsidiaries and is actively involved in mergers and acquisitions to expand its businesses. Tucker analyzes a number of companies, including Hanchin Corporation. When Tucker speaks with the CEO of Bowron, she indicates many of the companies she has looked at would be attractive acquisition targets for Bowron. After her discussion with the CEO, Tucker purchases 100,000 shares of Hanchin Corporation at $200 per share. Bowron does not have any pre-clearance procedures, so the next time she meets with the CEO, Tucker mentions she owns shares of Hanchin. The CEO thanks her for this information but does not ask for any details. Two weeks later, Tucker sees a company-wide email from the CEO announcing Bowron's acquisition of Hanchin for $250 a share. In regard to her purchase of Hanchin stock, Tucker least likely violated the CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct concerning:</question>

B is correct because a violation of Standard II (A) Material Nonpublic Information is likely to occur when using information that is selectively disclosed by corporations to a small group of investors, analysts, or other market participants. Earnings estimates given in a one-on-one meeting would likely be considered material and nonpublic information. Information made available to analysts remains nonpublic until it is made available to investors in general. Under the mosaic theory, it is acceptable to use information from industry contacts as long as the analyst uses appropriate methods to arrive at her conclusions.

Calculate the value of a bond (coupon and zero-coupon); Explain how the price of a bond changes if the discount rate changes and as the bond approaches its maturity date. C is correct. The book value of the bonds on 1 January 2012 is equal to the present value of the remaining coupon payments and principal discounted at the market rate at time of issue (3% per period). Coupon = 0.08 x x 5,000,000 = 200,000; there are four years remaining or eight coupon payments Book value = 200,000 PVAnnuity (n = 8, I = 3%) + 5,000,000 PV (n = 8, I = 3%) = 1,403,938 + 3,947,046 = 5,350,984 Using a financial calculator: PMT = 200,000; FV = 5,000,000; I% =3%; N = 8; Compute PV = 5,350,984 Because the market interest rate when the bonds are bought back (8%) is equal to the coupon rate, the company can buy back the bonds at par, $5,000,000: Cost of repurchase $5,000,000 Book value 5,350,984 Gain on retirement 350,984 On the cash flow statement, the gain would be deducted from net income when calculating the cash from operations under the indirect method, and the cash paid to repurchase the bonds would be a cash outflow in the financing section.</comments>

B is correct because yield to maturity does consider reinvestment income; however, it assumes that the coupon payments can be reinvested at an interest rate equal to the yield to maturity. This is one of the limitations for the yield-to-maturity measure because the investor is facing re-investment risk (future interest rates will be less than the yield to maturity at the time the bond is purchased).</comments>

C is correct because Standard I (B) Independence and Objectivity requires members and candidates to use reasonable care and judgment to maintain their independence and objectivity in their professional activities. Best practice dictates that Kumar only accept transportation to the remote mining sites in that it is unlikely he would be able to source commercial flights to the locations and ground transport may not be viable. Because Kumar would normally visit mining sites around the world as part of his job and because he is combining this trip with trip to other mine sites in different countries, it would be inappropriate for Cerberus to pay for the analyst's travel expenses from London. Although Kumar could go on safari with the group of analysts, he should pay his own way so as to restrict any influence such a gift could possibly have when making his investment recommendations on Cerberus.</comments>

C is correct because Standard III (A) Loyalty, Prudence and Care stipulates that the client owns the brokerage.

B is correct because Standard VI (B) Priority of Transactions dictates members and candidates give their clients and employer priority when making personal investment transactions. Even when clients allow or insist the manager invest alongside them, the manager's transactions must never adversely affect the interests of the clients. A popular or "hot" IPO in a frontier market is likely to be oversubscribed.

A micro finance loan company lent her money to pay off the tuition loan in full, including penalties and interest. The micro finance loan company even extended further credit to pay for her parents' outstanding medical bills. Unfortunately, her parents' health problems escalated to the point where Ng had to take extensive time away from work to deal with the issues.

A is correct because although Ng's first loan default, which played a part in the subsequent bankruptcy, is a result of poor financial choices (i.e. paying for higher wedding costs rather than her tuition loan), neither of the loan defaults or the bankruptcy involves fraudulent or deceitful business conduct but are based on unfortunate personal circumstances.

        <question id="8">Charles Mbuwanga, a Level III CFA Candidate, is the business development manager for Sokoza Investment Group, an investment management firm with high-net-worth retail clients throughout Africa. Sokoza introduced listed Kenyan Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) to its line of investment products based on new regulations introduced in Kenya so as to diversify its product offering to clients. The product introduction comes after months of researching Kenyan property correlations with other property markets and asset classes in Africa. Sokoza assigns Mbuwanga as part of the sales team in introducing this product to its clients across Africa. Mbuwanga subsequently determines most of Sokoza's clients' portfolios would benefit from having a small Kenyan property exposure to help diversify their investment portfolios.

C is correct because there is no indication Mbuwanga's recommendation is based on any compensation package based on sales targets as being part of the sales team. If he had a sales target as part of his responsibility to promote the new product, it could be conceived that his independence and objectively was in question. Mbuwanga does, however, seem to be in violation of Standard III (C) Suitability in that, although research with regard to correlation was undertaken, an analysis based on each individual client's return and risk objectives was not done. He may also be in violation of Standard I (A) Knowledge of the Law in that he would need to determine if the Kenyan REIT product is allowable in each of the countries where his clients reside.</comments>

B is correct because the offering of increased benefits to encourage staff retention would not necessarily stop the unethical behavior causing staff turnover and would effectively be asking the ethical employees to ignore the unethical behavior, thus being complicit in the behavior. Under Standard I (A) Knowledge of the Law, CFA charterholders and candidates must disassociate themselves from unethical behavior. Because the unethical business practices are seen as systemic, it would likely require them to leave the firm. Implementing a whistleblowing policy and adopting a corporate code of ethics would likely help to build a foundation of strong ethical behavior.</comments>

Across two periods, there are four possibilities: • an up move followed by an up move ($96.8 end value), • an up move followed by a down move ($79.2 end value), a down move followed by an up move ($79.2 end value), and • a down move followed by a down move ($64.8 end value). The probability of an up move followed by a down move is 0.75 x 0.25 = 0.1875. The probability of a down move followed by an up move is 0.25 x 0.75 also = 0.1875.

First, find the position of the first quintile with the following formula: Ly = (n + 1) x (y / 100), where y is the percentage point at which we are dividing the distribution. In our case we have y = 20, which corresponds to the 20th percentile (first quintile); n is the number of observations (funds) in the peer group. In our case we have n = 13; L20 corresponds to the location of the 20th percentile (first quintile). L20 = (13 + 1) x (20/100) = 2.80. Therefore, the location of the first quintile is between the volatility of Fund 2 and Fund 3 (because they are ranked in ascending order). Then, use linear interpolation to find the approximate value of the first quintile: P20 * X2 + (2.80 - 2) x (X3- X2), where X2 is the volatility of Fund 2 X3 is the volatility of Fund 3 P20 is the approximate value of the first quintile P20 s 10.12% + (2.80 - 2) x (10.84% -10.12%) = 10.70%</comments>

Therefore, the market is not semi-strong form efficient. A market that is not semi-strong form efficient is also not strong form efficient. Thus, violating the semi-strong form efficiency also implies violating the strong form efficiency. However, the market could still be weak form efficient, as past prices are not being used to make abnormal profits. Thus, we cannot say that the weak form market efficiency has been violated.</comments>

Calculate and interpret the intrinsic value of an equity security based on the Gordon (constant) growth dividend discount model or a two-stage dividend discount model, as appropriate. C is correct. The price-to-book ratio, which is also referred to as the market-to-book ratio, provides an indication of investors' expectations about a company's future investment and cash flow-generating opportunities. The larger the price-to-book ratio (i.e., the greater the divergence between market value per share and book value per share), the more favorably investors will view the company's future investment opportunities. In this case, as shown below, Company A has lower price-to-book ratio than Company B and therefore an expectation of lower future investment opportunities.

Although the substitution effect is always positive for all goods, for a Giffen good, the income effect is so strong and so negative that it overpowers the substitution effect. The result is that as its price declines, less of it is purchased; this relationship results in a positively sloped individual demand curve.

        <question id="46">At the start of the year a company that uses U.S. GAAP entered a contract to design and build a bridge with the following terms: Contract length 3 years $40 million Fixed contract price Estimated contract cost Costs incurred in first year $32 million $12 million The company was initially quite certain about its cost estimates and intended to recognize revenue based on them. However, unexpected problems during the first year have caused engineers to suggest that a more expensive design may be required, costing up to $8 million more. If the appropriate design cannot be determined before the company's financial statements are issued, the difference in the amount of revenue the company would recognize is closest to:</question>

        </choices>
        <answer>A</answer>
        <comments>U.S. GAAP requires that long term contracts whose outcomes can be reliably measured should be accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method, based on the stage of completion. Under the original assumptions, the company would have recognized $15 million of revenue. Calculations Under the Percentage-of-Completion Method Costs incurred to date $12 million Estimated total costs $32 million % total costs incurred to date 37.5% Total contract revenue $40 million % revenue to be recognized 37.5% Current year revenue $15 million Now that the company is unclear on the appropriate design and thus the cost, the outcome cannot be reliably measured. The completed contract method is used. Under this approach, no revenue ($ 0) is recognized until the contract is substantially complete. The difference in reported revenue under the two methods is: $15 million - $0 = $15 million. CFA Level I "Understanding Income Statements," Elaine Henry and Thomas R.

        <question id="47">Previously, a manufacturer of high-quality industrial electrical generators only sold its units to customers, but it has just introduced a leasing program. The generators have expected useful lives of about 25 years, and the company anticipates that the leases will have a term of 20 years or more. The company reports under International Financial Reporting Standards. Which of the following statements about the first year of the new leasing program is most accurate?</question>

        <answer>B</answer>
        <comments>Whether the company sells or leases the asset, inventory will be reduced. For sales, the company would report an accounts receivable classified as a current asset (assuming sales terms are not in question). If the leases qualify as finance leases, then the company will report a lease receivable, which is primarily long term. Therefore, compared with selling units outright, the company's current assets are lower under leasing and its liquidity position will decrease.

With payments in advance, there would be no lease receivable arising from the operating lease; long-term lease receivables arise from financing leases, not operating leases. Although revenues will increase by the lease payments, the leased assets are depreciated, and therefore EBIT will increase by the lease payment received minus depreciation expense.

        <question id="68">The notes to the financial statements of a company reporting under US GAAP contains the following information for the year 2014: Note 11. Property and Equipment (all figures in $ thousands) Depreciation expense for 2014 is $362. This amount includes capitalized interest of $143. Interest is allocated and capitalized to construction in progress by applying the firm's cost of borrowing rate to qualifying assets. Interest capitalized in 2014 is $170.

        <comments>The expensing of the previously capitalized interest is a non-cash amount and does not affect cash flow from operations. Under US GAAP, cash flow from operations is higher as a result of the initial capitalizing of interest but not its subsequent expensing. If the interest had not been capitalized, interest expense would have been greater and net income and cash from operations lower. CFA Level I "Long-Lived Assets," Elaine Henry and Elizabeth A. Gordon

She is currently brokering the sale of a commercial property on behalf of a client in financial distress. If the client's building is not sold within 30 days, he will lose the building to the bank. A year earlier, another client of Kozniak's had expressed interest in purchasing this same property. However, she is unable to contact this client, and she has not discovered any other potential buyers. Given her distressed client's limited time frame, Kozniak purchases the property herself and forgoes any sales commission.

In addition, in both cases, she acts for her own account as a primary investor, not as a broker. She buys the property for her own portfolio and then sells the property from her own portfolio. Therefore, Kozniak did not violate Standard VI(A)-Disclosure of Conflicts. When she purchased the property for her portfolio, she saved her client from losing the building to the bank and did not charge a sales commission. Because the sale of the property to her other client did not take place until six months after her purchase, and she was unable to contact the client who had earlier expressed interest prior to her purchase, she cannot be accused of violating Standard III(A)-Loyalty, Prudence, and Care with either client.

        <answer>A</answer>
        <comments>By failing to adhere to the non-compete clause he agreed to abide by when signing his employment contract, Hasina shows a lack of professional integrity toward his employer. This behavior reflects poorly on the good reputation of members and is a violation of the Code of Ethics, which states that members and candidates must act with integrity, and Standard I (D) Misconduct, which states that members and candidates must not engage in any professional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit or commit any act that reflects adversely on their professional reputation, integrity, or competence. The Code of Ethics at times requires a member or candidate to uphold a higher standard than that required by law, rule, or regulation or in this case, the strict application of the employment agreement.

        <question id="62">An e-commerce company sells hotel room nights on its website under agreement from a large number of major hotel chains. The hotel chains grant the company flexibility for the rooms they supply to the company's website and for the prices charged. These major chains bear the responsibility for providing all services once a customer books a room from the website. During the current year, the company received $5 million in payments from the sale of hotel rooms. The cost of these rooms was $4.5 million, which does not include $250,000 in direct selling costs.

        <comments>Cost of sales is reported on the same basis as revenue.

Not met bear the inventory risk and credit risk. Not met be able to choose its supplier. Met also have reasonable latitude to establish pricing. Met The first criterion is not met. The major hotel chains have the obligation of fulfilling the room contract once it is entered into. The second criterion is not met either because the e-commerce company did not incur costs for vacant rooms. The major chains bear the inventory risk. Because all criteria are not met, the e-commerce company must use net reporting for which revenue is $500,000 and cost of sales is $250,000. CFA Level I</comments>

        <comments>The put option feature facilitates raising capital because the shares are more appealing to investors. As such, it provides a benefit to the issuing company. It also helps investors limit their potential losses because they can sell the shares back to the issuing company if the market price falls below the pre-specified put price. Therefore, putable common shares are beneficial to both the issuing company and the investors. CFA Level I “Overview of Equity Securities,” Ryan C. Fuhrmann and Asjeet S. Lamba Section 3</comments>

        <question id="9">When Abdullah Younis, CFA, was hired as a portfolio manager at an asset management firm two years ago, he was told he could allocate his work hours as he saw fit. At that time, Younis served on the board of three non-public golf equipment companies and managed a pooled investment fund for several members of his immediate family. Younis was not compensated for his board service or for managing the pooled fund. Younis's investment returns attract interest from friends and co-workers who persuade him to include their assets in his investment pool. Younis recently retired from all board responsibilities and now spends more than 80% of his time managing the investment pool for which he charges non-family members a management fee. Younis has never told his employer about any of these activities.

        <question id="12">Thomas Turkman recently hired Georgia Viggen, CFA, as a portfolio manager for North South Bank. Although Viggen worked many years for a competitor, West Star Bank, the move was straightforward because she did not have a non-compete agreement with her previous employer.

Using public information, Viggen contacts all of her former clients to convince them to move with her to North South.

But Hajak has violated Standard V(C): Record Retention because when she left the bank, she took the property of the bank without express permission to do so. In addition, she violated Standard I(C); Misrepresentation by creating research materials without attribution, which is demonstrated when she adds to the new report a real estate study she saw in the Wall Street Journal and only references the Journal.

Using the CAPM, the company's cost of equity = 3.50% + 1.80(5.25%) = 12.95%.

Unfortunately, her parents' health problems escalated to the point that Ng had to take extensive time away from work to deal with the issues.

He recently had the opportunity to buy 100,000 shares in a publicly listed company whose prospects are considered "above industry norm" by most analysts.

However, trading the stock of a company the analyst recommended as an acquisition candidate does violate Standard IV(A): Loyalty because she did not give her employer the opportunity to take advantage of her skill/recommendation prior to buying the shares for her own portfolio. In addition, the analyst violated Standard VI(B): Priority of Transactions, which requires that investment transactions for clients and employers must have priority over investment transactions in which a member or candidate is the beneficial owner despite the fact that there are no stock pre-clearance procedures at Bowron.</comments>

        <question id="15">Kelly Amadon, CFA, an investment adviser, has two clients: Ryan Randolf, 65 years old, and Keiko Kitagawa, 45 years old. Both clients earn the same amount in salary. Randolf, however, has a large amount of assets, whereas Kitagawa has few assets outside her investment portfolio. Randolf is single and willing to invest a portion of his assets very aggressively; Kitagawa wants to achieve a steady rate of return with low volatility so she can pay for her child's current college expenses. Amadon recommends investing 20% of both clients' portfolios in the stock of very low-yielding small cap companies.

        <question id="17">Charles Mbuwanga, a Level III CFA candidate, is the business development manager for Sokoza Investment Group, an investment management firm with high-net-worth retail clients throughout Africa. Sokoza introduced listed Kenyan REITs (real estate investment trusts) to its line of investment products based on new regulations introduced in Kenya to diversify its product offering to clients. The product introduction comes after months of researching Kenyan property correlations with other property markets and asset classes in Africa. Sokoza assigns Mbuwanga as part of the sales team that will introduce this product to its clients across Africa. Mbuwanga subsequently determines most of Sokoza's clients' portfolios would benefit from having a small Kenyan property exposure to help diversify their investment portfolios. By promoting the Kenyan REITs for Sokoza's client portfolios as planned, Mbuwanga would least likely violate which of the following standards?</question>

If he had a sales target as part of his responsibility to promote the new product, it could be conceived that his independence and objectivity would be in question. Mbuwanga does, however, seem to be in violation of Standard III(C): Suitability because although research with regard to correlation was undertaken, an analysis based on each individual client's return and risk objectives was not done.

Musa violated Standard IV(C)-Responsibilities of Supervisors by not ensuring policies were in place to prevent violations of the Standards of Professional Conduct (in this case, Standard VI(B)-Priority of Transactions) by someone subject to her supervision. As the head of compliance, Musa supervised Kassim and must meet her supervisory responsibilities outlined in the Standards of Professional Conduct. Kassim violated Standard VI(B)-Priority of Transactions because he did not give sufficient priority to Dunfield's clients before trading on his recommendation.

        <comments>Under IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), first determine the recoverable amount, which is the higher of 1. value in use (the present value of the expected future cash flows) = $32,000 or 2. fair value minus costs to sell = $34,000 — 4,000 = $30,000 The recoverable amount ($32,000) is lower than the carrying value ($36,000). Therefore, the asset is impaired and should be written down to that amount. Under US GAAP, to assess impairment, the carrying value ($36,000) is compared with the undiscounted expected future cash flows ($38,000).

        <comments>In a semi-strong efficient market, prices adjust quickly and accurately to new information. In this case, prices would quickly adjust to the merger announcement, and if the market is a semi-strong efficient market, investors acting after the merger announcement would not be able to earn abnormal returns. Therefore, the market is not semi-strong-form efficient. A market that is not semi-strong-form efficient is also not strong-form efficient. Thus, violating the semi-strong-form efficiency also implies violating the strong-form efficiency. However, the market could still be weak-form efficient because past prices are not being used to make abnormal profits. Thus, we cannot say that the weak-form market efficiency has been violated.

This is one of the limitations for the yield to maturity measure because the investor is facing reinvestment risk (future interest rates will be less than the yield to maturity at the time the bond is purchased).

In addition, in both cases, she acts for her own account as a primary investor, not as a broker. She buys the property for her own portfolio and then sells the property from her own portfolio. Therefore, Kozniak did not violate Standard VI(A)-Disclosure of Conflicts. When she purchased the property for her portfolio, she saved her client from losing the building to the bank and did not charge a sales commission. Because the sale of the property to her other client did not take place until six months after her purchase, and she was unable to contact the client who had earlier expressed interest prior to her purchase, she cannot be accused of violating Standard III(A)-Loyalty, Prudence, and Care with either client.

        <question id="11">Molly Burnett, CFA, is a portfolio manager for a fund that only invests in environmentally friendly companies. A multinational utility company recently acquired one of the fund's best-performing investments, a wind power company. The wind power company's shareholders received utility company shares as part of the merger agreement. The utility has one of the worst environmental records in the industry, but its shares have been one of the top performers over the past 12 months. Because the utility pays a high dividend every three months, Burnett holds the utility shares until the remaining two dividends are paid for the year then sells the shares.

To connect the two values algebraically: (NI/20 million) xX = [NI x (1 - 20%)/15 million] X = (1 - 20%) x (20 million/15 million) = 1.067 Because X is greater than 1, the EPS has increased after the repurchase.

If markets are weak-form efficient, investment strategies based on fundamental analysis of public information and past market data could achieve abnormal returns.

        <comments>For a violation of the strong form of market efficiency to occur, the strategy based on fundamental analysis must achieve a net return higher than the net return of the passive strategy, on a risk adjusted basis. This threshold corresponds to 15% because both strategies had the same systematic risk and the passive strategy has no fees or expenses. To find the gross return on the strategy that uses fundamental analysis, the fees and expenses must be added to the net return: Gross return = Net return + Fees and expenses = 15% + 2% = 17%. Anything in excess of 17% would violate the strong form of market efficiency for the fundamental analysis strategy. CFA Level i "Market Efficiency," W. Sean Cleary, Howard J.

        <comments>When interest rates are rising, the put option becomes more valuable to the investor. The ability to sell the bond at par value limits the price depreciation as rates rise. So, the presence of an embedded put option reduces the sensitivity of the bond price to changes in interest rates, resulting in a lower effective duration.

        <question id="68">The following excerpt was taken from the notes of a company's financial statements that were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. All figures are in thousands of Australian dollars. Note 12: Broadcast Licenses During 2014, the company successfully disposed of broadcast licenses that were held for sale for A$37,900 (net book value of A$23,500). Based on the successful completion of that sale, the impairment losses taken in 2012 on other licenses have been reversed, restoring those intangible assets to their amortized historical cost. Broadcast licenses are amortized over a period of 15–25 years. The note leads an analyst to believe that the rapid reversal of the impairment loss related to the broadcast licenses arose as an attempt by management to manage earnings. If the analyst's belief is correct, her analysis of the original 2013 financial statements would most likely have shown that, compared with the economic reality in 2013, the company had:</question>
