{"id": 2488, "text": "If the percentage of equity in a margin account falls below the maintenance margin\nrequirement, the investor will receive a margin call, a request to bring the equity\npercentage in the account back up to the maintenance margin percentage. An investor\ncan satisfy this request by depositing additional funds or depositing other unmargined\nsecurities that will bring the equity percentage up to the minimum requirement. If the\ninvestor does not meet the margin call, the broker must sell the position.\n"}
