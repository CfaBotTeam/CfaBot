The investor's ownership interests are referred to as shares, units, depository\nreceipts, or limited partnership interests.\n\u2022 Mutual funds are pooled investment vehicles in which investors can purchase shares,\neither from the fund itself (open-end funds) or in the secondary market (closed-end\nfunds).\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) trade like\nclosed-end funds but have special provisions allowing conversion into individual\nportfolio securities, or exchange of portfolio shares for ETF shares, that keep their\nmarket prices close to the value of their proportional interest in the overall portfolio.\nThese funds are sometimes referred to as depositories, with their shares referred to as\ndepository receipts.\nAsset-backed securities represent a claim to a portion of a pool of financial assets\nsuch as mortgages, car loans, or credit card debt. The return from the assets is passed\nthrough to investors, with different classes of claims (referred to as tranches) having\ndifferent levels of risk.\nHedge funds are organized as limited partnerships, with the investors as the limited\npartners and the fund manager as the general partner. Hedge funds utilize various\nstrategies and purchase is usually restricted to investors of substantial wealth and\ninvestment knowledge. Hedge funds often use leverage. Hedge fund managers are\ncompensated based on the amount of assets under management as well as on their\ninvestment results.\nProfessor's Note: Asset-backed securities are described in more detail in the Study\nSession on fixed income. Mutual funds and ETFs are discussed in the Study\nSession on portfolio management. Hedge funds are discussed in the Study Session\non alternative investments.\n"}
