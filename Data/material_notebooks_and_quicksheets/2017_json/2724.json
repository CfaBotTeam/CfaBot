{"id": "2724", "text": "Government Classifications\nSeveral government bodies also provide industry classification of firms. They frequently\ndo so to organize the economic data they publish. A main thrust of their systems is to\nmake comparisons of industries consistent across time and country. The main systems\nare similar to each other.\n\u2022 International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) was\nproduced by the United Nations in 1948 to increase global comparability of data.\nStatistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community is similar to\nthe ISIC but is designed for Europe.\nAustralian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification was jointly developed\nby those countries.\nNorth American Industry Classification System (NAICS) was jointly developed by the\nUnited States, Canada, and Mexico.\nThe methodologies that government providers use in their compilation of industry\ngroups differ from those used by commercial providers. Most governments do not\nidentify individual firms in a group, so an analyst cannot know the groups' exact\ncomposition. Commercial providers identify the constituent firms. Government\nsystems are updated less frequently; for example, the NAICS is updated every five years.\nGovernments do not distinguish between small and large firms, for-profit and not-forprofit organizations, or private and public firms. Commercial providers only include forprofit and public firms and can delineate by the size of the firm.\n"}
