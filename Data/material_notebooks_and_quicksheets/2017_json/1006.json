{"id": "1006", "text": "LOS 17.b\nInventory to sales ratios typically increase late in expansions when sales slow and\ndecrease near the end of contractions when sales begin to accelerate. Firms decrease or\nincrease production to restore their inventory-sales ratios to their desired levels.\nBecause hiring and laying off employees have high costs, firms prefer to adjust their\nutilization of current employees. As a result, firms are slow to lay off employees early in\ncontractions and slow to add employees early in expansions.\nFirms use their physical capital more intensively during expansions, investing in new\ncapacity only if they believe the expansion is likely to continue. They use physical capital\nless intensively during contractions, but they are more likely to reduce capacity by\ndeferring maintenance and not replacing equipment than by selling their physical capital.\n"}
