{"id": "1962", "text": "LOS 28.\nUnder LIFO, cost of sales reflects the most recent purchase or production costs, and\nbalance sheet inventory values reflect older outdated costs.\nUnder FIFO, cost of sales reflects the oldest purchase or production costs for inventory,\nand balance sheet inventory values reflect the most recent costs.\nUnder the weighted average cost method, cost of sales and balance sheet inventory values\nare between those of LIFO and FIFO.\nWhen purchase or production costs are rising, LIFO cost of sales is higher than FIFO\ncost of sales, and LIFO gross profit is lower than FIFO gross profit as a result, LIFO\ninventory is lower than FIFO inventory.\nWhen purchase or production costs are falling, LIFO cost of sales is lower than FIFO\ncost of sales, and LIFO gross profit is higher than FIFO gross profit as a result, LIFO\ninventory is higher than FIFO inventory.\nIn either case, LIFO cost of sales and FIFO inventory values better represent economic\nreality (replacement costs).\nIn a periodic system, inventory values and COGS are determined at the end of the\naccounting period. In a perpetual system, inventory values and COGS are updated\ncontinuously.\nIn the case of FIFO and specific identification, ending inventory values and COGS are\nthe same whether a periodic or perpetual system is used. LIFO and weighted average cost,\nhowever, can produce different inventory values and COGS depending on whether a\nperiodic or perpetual system is used.\n\u00a92016 Kaplan, Inc.\n"}
