{"id": "3862", "text": "A loan is said to be partially amortizing when loan payments include some repayment of\nprincipal, but there is a lump sum of principal that remains to be paid at the end of the\nloan period which is called a balloon payment. With an interest-only mortgage, there is\nno principal repayment for either an initial period or the life of the loan. If no principal\nis paid for the life of the loan it is an interest-only lifetime mortgage and the balloon\npayment is the original loan principal amount. Other interest-only mortgages specify\nthat payments are interest-only over some initial period, with partial or full amortization\nof principal after that.\n"}
