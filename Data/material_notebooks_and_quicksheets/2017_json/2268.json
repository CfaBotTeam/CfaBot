{"id": 2268, "text": "Combining a risky portfolio with a risk-free asset is the process that supports the twofund separation theorem, which states that all investors' optimum portfolios will be\nmade up of some combination of an optimal portfolio of risky assets and the risk-free\nasset. The line representing these possible combinations of risk-free assets and the\noptimal risky asset portfolio is referred to as the capital allocation line.\nPoint X on the capital allocation line in Figure 5 represents a portfolio that is 40%\ninvested in the risky asset portfolio and 60% invested in the risk-free asset. Its expected\nreturn will be 0.40[E(Rrisky asset portfolio)] + 0.60(RF), and its standard deviation will be\n0.40(o risky asset portfolio\n"}
