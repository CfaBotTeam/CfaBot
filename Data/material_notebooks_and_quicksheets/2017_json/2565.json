{"id": 2565, "text": "index weights of stocks to their proportions of the total value of all the shares of index\nstocks that are actually available to investors.\nA float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index is constructed like a market\ncapitalization-weighted index. The weights, however, are based on the proportionate\nvalue of each firm's shares that are available to investors to the total market value of\nthe shares of index stocks that are available to investors. Firms with relatively large\npercentages of their shares held by controlling stockholders will have less weight than\nthey have in an unadjusted market-capitalization index.\nThe advantage of market capitalization-weighted indexes of either type is that index\nsecurity weights represent proportions of total market value. The primary disadvantage\nof value-weighted indexes is that the relative impact of a stock's return on the index\nincreases as its price rises and decreases as its price falls. This means that stocks that\nare possibly overvalued are given disproportionately high weights in the index and\nstocks that are possibly undervalued are given disproportionately low weights. Holding\na portfolio that tracks a value-weighted index is, therefore, similar to following a\nmomentum strategy, under which the most successful stocks are given the greatest\nweights and poor performing stocks are underweighted.\n"}
