{"id": 3012, "text": "The marginal cost of capital (MCC) is the cost of the last new dollar of capital a firm\nraises. As a firm raises more and more capital, the costs of different sources of financing\nwill increase. For example, as a firm raises additional debt, the cost of debt will rise to\naccount for the additional financial risk. This will occur, for example, if bond covenants\nin the firm's existing senior debt agreement prohibit the firm from issuing additional\ndebt with the same seniority as the existing debt. Therefore, the company will have to\nissue more expensive subordinated bonds at a higher cost of debt, which increases the\nmarginal cost of capital.\n"}
