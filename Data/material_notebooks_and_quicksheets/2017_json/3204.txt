{"id": 3204, "text": "Earlier, we illustrated the effect of a change in yield that occurs prior to the first\ncoupon payment. Our results showed that for an investor with a short investment\nhorizon (anticipated holding period), the market price risk of the bond outweighs its\nreinvestment risk. Because of this, an increase in yield prior to the first coupon date\nwas shown to reduce the horizon yield for a short investment horizon and increase the\nhorizon yield for a longer-term investment horizon. For a longer investment horizon, the\nincrease in reinvestment income from the yield increase was greater than the decrease in\nthe sale price of the bond.\n"}
