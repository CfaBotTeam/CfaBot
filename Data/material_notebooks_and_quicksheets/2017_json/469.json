{"id": 469, "text": "Do these numbers look familiar? They should! In our review of common probability\ndistributions, we found the probability under the standard normal curve between\nz = -1.96 and z = +1.96 to be 0.95, or 95%. Owing to symmetry, this leaves a\nprobability of 0.025 under each tail of the curve beyond z = -1.96 or z = +1.96, for a\ntotal of 0.05, or 5%\u2014just what we need for a significance level of 0.05, or 5%.\n"}
