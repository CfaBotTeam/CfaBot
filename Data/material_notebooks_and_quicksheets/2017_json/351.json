{"id": 351, "text": "The Binomial Distribution\nA binomial random variable may be defined as the number of \u201csuccesses\u201d in a given\nnumber of trials, whereby the outcome can be either \u201csuccess\u201d or \u201cfailure.\u201d The\nprobability of success, p, is constant for each trial, and the trials are independent. A\nbinomial random variable for which the number of trials is 1 is called a Bernoulli\nrandom variable. Think of a trial as a mini-experiment (or \u201cBernoulli trial\u201d). The final\noutcome is the number of successes in a series of n trials. Under these conditions, the\nbinomial probability function defines the probability of x successes in n trials. It can be\nexpressed using the following formula:\np(x) = P(X = x) = (number of ways to choose x from n)p*(1 - p)n-*\nwhere:\nn!\n(number of ways to choose x from n) = 7\n- which may also be denoted as\n(n-x)!x!\n"}
