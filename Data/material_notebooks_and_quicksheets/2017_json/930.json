{"id": "930", "text": "Example: Computing PV of an uneven cash flow series\nCompute the present value of this 6-year uneven cash flow stream described above\nusing a 10% rate of return.\nAnswer:\nThis problem is solved by first computing the PV of each individual cash flow, then\nsumming the PVs of the individual cash flows, which yields the PV of the cash flow\nstream. Again the signs of the cash flows are preserved.\nPV: FV = -1,000; I/Y = 10; N = 1; CPT + PV = PV = -909.09\nPV,: FV =-500; I/Y = 10; N = 2; CPT + PV = PV, = -413.22\nPVZ: FV = 0; I/Y = 10; N = 3; CPT \u2013 PV = PV; = 0\nPV4: FV = 4,000; I/Y = 10; N = 4; CPT + PV = PV4 = 2,732.05\nPV: FV = 3,500; I/Y = 10; N = 5; CPT + PV = PV= 2,173.22\nPV: FV = 2,000; I/Y = 10; N = 6; CPT + PV = PV, = 1,128,95\nPV of cash flow stream = CPV individual = $4,711.91\n"}
