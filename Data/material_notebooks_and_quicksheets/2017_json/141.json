{"id": "141", "text": "The sample variance, , is the measure of dispersion that applies when we are evaluating\na sample of n observations from a population. The sample variance is calculated using\nthe following formula:\n2X; -x)?\nn-1\nThe most noteworthy difference from the formula for population variance is that the\ndenominator for sa is n \u2013 1, one less than the sample size n, where o? uses the entire\npopulation size N. Another difference is the use of the sample mean, X, instead of the\npopulation mean, p. Based on the mathematical theory behind statistical procedures,\nthe use of the entire number of sample observations, n, instead of n - 1 as the divisor in\nthe computation of 2, will systematically underestimate the population parameter, o\u00ba,\nparticularly for small sample sizes. This systematic underestimation causes the sample\nvariance to be what is referred to as a biased estimator of the population variance. Using\nn-1 instead of n in the denominator, however, improves the statistical properties of $2\nas an estimator of o?. Thus, Z, as expressed in the equation above, is considered to be an\nunbiased estimator of o?.\n"}
