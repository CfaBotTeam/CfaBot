{"id": 927, "text": "This 6-year cash flow series is not an annuity since the cash flows are different every year.\nIn fact, there is one year with zero cash flow and two others with negative cash flows. In\nessence, this series of uneven cash flows is nothing more than a stream of annual single\nsum cash flows. Thus, to find the PV or FV of this cash flow stream, all we need to do is\nsum the PVs or FVs of the individual cash flows.\n"}
