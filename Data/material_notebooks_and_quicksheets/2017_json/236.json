{"id": 236, "text": "EXPECTED VALUE\nNow that we have developed some probability concepts and tools for working with\nprobabilities, we can apply this knowledge to determine the average value for a random\nvariable that results from multiple experiments. This average is called an expected value.\nIn any given experiment, the observed value for a random variable may not equal its\nexpected value, and even if it does, the outcome from one observation to the next will be\ndifferent. The degree of dispersion of outcomes around the expected value of a random\nvariable is measured using the variance and standard deviation. When pairs of random\nvariables are being observed, the covariance and correlation are used to measure the\nextent of the relationship between the observed values for the two variables from one\nobservation to the next.\n"}
