{"id": "641", "text": "The analyst should most appropriately:\nA. reject the null hypothesis.\nB. fail to reject the null hypothesis.\nC. reach no conclusion because the sample standard deviation was not given.\nA study was conducted to determine whether the standard deviation of monthly\nmaintenance costs of a Pepper III aircraft is $300. A sample of 30 Pepper IIIs\nhad a mean monthly maintenance cost of $3,025 and a standard deviation\nof $325. Using a 5% level of significance and assuming costs are normally\ndistributed, which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion regarding\nthe difference between the hypothesized value of the population variance and the\nsample variance?\nA. The population and sample variances are significantly different.\nB. The population and sample variances are not significantly different.\nC. There are no tests that may be used to test variance differences in small\nsamples.\n"}
