{"id": 179, "text": "Unethical behavior by financial services professionals can have negative effects for society\nas a whole. The financial services industry serves as an intermediary between savers and\nthose seeking financing for their business activities. A lack of trust in financial advisors\nwill reduce the funds entrusted to them and increase the cost of raising capital for\nbusiness investment and growth. When investors cannot rely on the information they\nreceive from financial services professionals, this adds another layer of risk on top of the\ninvestment risks that investors face. Even the perception of additional risk will reduce\nthe amounts invested and increase the returns required to attract investor capital.\n"}
