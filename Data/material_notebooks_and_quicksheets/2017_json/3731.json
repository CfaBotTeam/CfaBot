The 10 coupon payments of $100 each\nare taken care of in the N = 10 and PMT = 100 entries. The principal repayment\nis in the FV = 1,000 entry. Lastly, note that the PV is negative; it will be the\nopposite sign to the sign of PMT and FV. The calculator is just \u201cthinking\u201d that to\nreceive the payments and future value (to own the bond), you must pay the present\nvalue of the bond today (you must buy the bond). That's why the PV amount is\nnegative; it is a cash outflow to a bond buyer.\n"}
