{"id": "390", "text": "In Figure 9, we can see that:\nThe lognormal distribution is skewed to the right.\nThe lognormal distribution is bounded from below by zero so that it is useful for\nmodeling asset prices which never take negative values.\nIf we used a normal distribution of returns to model asset prices over time, we would\nadmit the possibility of returns less than -100%, which would admit the possibility of\nasset prices less than zero. Using a lognormal distribution to model price relatives avoids\nthis problem. A price relative is just the end-of-period price of the asset divided by the\nbeginning price (S/S,) and is equal to (1 + the holding period return). To get the endof-period asset price, we can simply multiply the price relative times the beginning-ofperiod asset price. Since a lognormal distribution takes a minimum value of zero, endof-period asset prices cannot be less than zero. A price relative of zero corresponds to a\nholding period return of -100% (i.e., the asset price has gone to zero). Recall that we\nused price relatives as the up-move and down-move (multiplier) terms in constructing a\nbinomial tree for stock price changes over a number of periods.\n"}
