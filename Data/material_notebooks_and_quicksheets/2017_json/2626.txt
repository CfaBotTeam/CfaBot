{"id": 2626, "text": "The results of tests of the various forms of market efficiency have implications about the\nvalue of technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and portfolio management in general.\nTechnical analysis seeks to earn positive risk-adjusted returns by using historical price\nand volume (trading) data. Tests of weak-form market efficiency have examined whether\ntechnical analysis produces abnormal profits. Generally, the evidence indicates that\ntechnical analysis does not produce abnormal profits, so we cannot reject the hypothesis\nthat markets are weak-form efficient. However, technical analysis has been shown to have\nsuccess in emerging markets, and there are so many possible technical analysis trading\nstrategies that they cannot all be tested. As noted previously, the success of any technical\nanalysis strategy should be evaluated considering the costs of information, analysis, and\ntrading.\nFundamental analysis is based on public information such as earnings, dividends, and\nvarious accounting ratios and estimates. The semi-strong form of market efficiency\nsuggests that all public information is already reflected in stock prices. As a result,\ninvestors should not be able to earn abnormal profits by trading on this information.\n"}
