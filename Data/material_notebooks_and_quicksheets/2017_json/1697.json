{"id": "1697", "text": "Operating Cash Flow\nAn analyst should identify the major determinants of operating cash flow. Positive\noperating cash flow can be generated by the firm's earnings-related activities. However,\npositive operating cash flow can also be generated by decreasing noncash working\ncapital, such as liquidating inventory and receivables or increasing payables. Decreasing\nnoncash working capital is not sustainable, since inventories and receivables cannot fall\nbelow zero and creditors will not extend credit indefinitely unless payments are made\nwhen due.\n"}
