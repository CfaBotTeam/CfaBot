{"id": 159, "text": "Skewness affects the location of the mean, median, and mode of a distribution.\nFor a symmetrical distribution, the mean, median, and mode are equal.\nFor a positively skewed, unimodal distribution, the mode is less than the median,\nwhich is less than the mean. The mean is affected by outliers; in a positively skewed\ndistribution, there are large, positive outliers which will tend to \u201cpull\u201d the mean\nupward, or more positive. An example of a positively skewed distribution is that\nof housing prices. Suppose that you live in a neighborhood with 100 homes; 99 of\nthem sell for $100,000, and one sells for $1,000,000. The median and the mode will\nbe $100,000, but the mean will be $109,000. Hence, the mean has been \"pulled\u201d\nupward (to the right) by the existence of one home (outlier) in the neighborhood.\nFor a negatively skewed, unimodal distribution, the mean is less than the median,\nwhich is less than the mode. In this case, there are large, negative outliers that tend\nto \u201cpull\u201d the mean downward (to the left).\n"}
