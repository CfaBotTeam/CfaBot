{"id": "3052", "text": "Leverage, in the sense we use it here, refers to the amount of fixed costs a firm has. These\nfixed costs may be fixed operating expenses, such as building or equipment leases, or\nfixed financing costs, such as interest payments on debt. Greater leverage leads to greater\nvariability of the firm's after-tax operating earnings and net income. A given change in\nsales will lead to a greater change in operating earnings when the firm employs operating\nleverage; a given change in operating earnings will lead to a greater change in net income\nwhen the firm employs financial leverage.\n"}
