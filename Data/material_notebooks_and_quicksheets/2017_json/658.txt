{"id": 658, "text": "Technical analysis is the study of collective market sentiment, as expressed in buying\nand selling of assets. It is based on the idea that prices are determined by the interaction\nof supply and demand. The market price equates supply and demand at any instant.\nOnly participants who actually trade affect prices, and better-informed participants tend\nto trade in greater volume. Thus, price and volume reflect the collective behavior of\nbuyers and sellers.\nA key assumption of technical analysis is that market prices reflect both rational and\nirrational investor behavior. This assumption implies that the efficient markets hypothesis\ndoes not hold. (The efficient markets hypothesis is described in the Study Session on\nsecurities markets.) Technical analysts believe investor behavior is reflected in trends and\npatterns that tend to repeat and can be identified and used for forecasting prices.\n"}
