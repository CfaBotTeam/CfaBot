{"id": "3270", "text": "The most common measures of leverage used by credit analysts are the debt-to-capital\nratio, the debt-to-EBITDA ratio, the FFO-to-debt ratio, and the ratio of FCF after\ndividends to debt.\n1. Debt/capital. Capital is the sum of total debt and shareholders' equity. The debt-tocapital ratio is the percentage of the capital structure financed by debt. A lower ratio\nindicates less credit risk. If the financial statements list high values for intangible\nassets such as goodwill, an analyst should calculate a second debt-to-capital ratio\nadjusted for a writedown of these assets after-tax value.\n2. Debt/EBITDA. A higher ratio indicates higher leverage and higher credit risk. This\nratio is more volatile for firms in cyclical industries or with high operating leverage\nbecause of their high variability of EBITDA.\n"}
