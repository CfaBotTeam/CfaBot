{"id": "2262", "text": "Assuming that investors are risk averse, investors prefer the portfolio that has the greatest\nexpected return when choosing among portfolios that have the same standard deviation\nof returns. Those portfolios that have the greatest expected return for each level of risk\n(standard deviation) make up the efficient frontier. The efficient frontier coincides with\nthe top portion of the minimum-variance frontier. A risk-averse investor would only\nchoose portfolios that are on the efficient frontier because all available portfolios that are\nnot on the efficient frontier have lower expected returns than an efficient portfolio with\nthe same risk. The portfolio on the efficient frontier that has the least risk is the global\nminimum-variance portfolio.\n"}
