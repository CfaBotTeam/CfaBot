{"id": 984, "text": "Other factors affect demand elasticity in addition to the quality and availability of\nsubstitutes:\nPortion of income spent on a good. The larger the proportion of income spent\non a good, the more elastic an individual's demand for that good. If the price of a\npreferred brand of toothpaste increases, a consumer may not change brands or adjust\nthe amount used if the customer prefers to simply pay the extra cost. When housing\ncosts increase, however, a consumer will be much more likely to adjust consumption,\nbecause rent is a fairly large proportion of income.\nTime. Elasticity of demand tends to be greater the longer the time period since\nthe price change. For example, when energy prices initially rise, some adjustments\nto consumption are likely made quickly. Consumers can lower the thermostat\ntemperature. Over time, adjustments such as smaller living quarters, better\ninsulation, more efficient windows, and installation of alternative heat sources are\nmore easily made, and the effect of the price change on consumption of energy is\ngreater.\nIt is important to understand that elasticity is not slope for demand curves. Slope\nis dependent on the units that price and quantity are measured in. Elasticity is not\ndependent on units of measurement because it is based on percentage changes.\nFigure 2 shows how elasticity changes along a linear demand curve. In the upper part\nof the demand curve, elasticity is greater (in absolute value) than 1; in other words, the\npercentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price.\nIn the lower part of the curve, the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller\nthan the percentage change in price.\n"}
