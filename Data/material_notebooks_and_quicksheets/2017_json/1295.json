{"id": "1295", "text": "12. C This exchange rate regime is a currency board arrangement. The country has not\nformally dollarized because it continues to issue a domestic currency. A conventional\nfixed peg allows for a small degree of fluctuation around the target exchange rate.\n13. A With perfectly inelastic demand for imports, currency devaluation of any size will\nincrease total expenditures on imports (same quantity at higher prices in the home\ncurrency). The trade deficit will narrow only if the increase in export revenues is larger\nthan the increase in import spending. To satisfy the Marshall-Lerner condition when\nimport demand elasticity is zero, export demand elasticity must be larger than the ratio\nof imports to exports in the country's international trade.\n14. A A devaluation of the currency will reduce the price of export goods in foreign currency\nterms. The greatest benefit would be to producers of goods with more elastic demand.\nLuxury goods tend to have higher elasticity of demand, while goods that have no close\nsubstitutes or represent a small proportion of consumer expenditures tend to have low\nelasticities of demand.\n15. B An improvement in a trade deficit requires that domestic savings increase relative to\ndomestic investment, which would decrease a capital account surplus. Decreasing\nexpenditures relative to income means domestic savings increase. Decreasing domestic\nsaving relative to domestic investment is consistent with a larger capital account surplus\n(an increase in net foreign borrowing) and a greater trade deficit.\n"}
