{"id": 367, "text": "Up to this point, our discussion has been strictly focused on univariate distributions\n(i.e., the distribution of a single random variable). In practice, however, the relationships\nbetween two or more random variables are often relevant. For instance, investors and\ninvestment managers are frequently interested in the interrelationship among the\nreturns of one or more assets. In fact, as you will see in your study of asset pricing\nmodels and modern portfolio theory, the return on a given stock and the return on the\nS&P 500 or some other market index will have special significance. Regardless of the\nspecific variables, the simultaneous analysis of two or more random variables requires an\nunderstanding of multivariate distributions.\n"}
