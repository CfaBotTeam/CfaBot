{"id": 3875, "text": "Based on an assumption about the prepayment rate for an MBS, we can calculate its\nweighted average life, or simply average life, which is the expected number of years until\nall the loan principal is repaid. Because of prepayments, the average life of an MBS will\nbe less than its weighted average maturity. During periods of falling interest rates, the\nrefinancing of mortgage loans will accelerate prepayments and reduce the average life of\nan MBS. A high PSA, such as 400, will reduce the average life of an MBS to only 4.5\nyears, compared to an average life of about 11 years for an MBS with a PSA of 100.\n"}
