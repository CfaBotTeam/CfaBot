{"id": 2047, "text": "Under U.S. GAAP, an asset is tested for impairment only when events and circumstances\nindicate the firm may not be able to recover the carrying value through future use.\nDetermining an impairment and calculating the loss potentially involves two steps. In\nthe first step, the asset is tested for impairment by applying a recoverability test. If the\nasset is impaired, the second step involves measuring the loss.\nRecoverability. An asset is considered impaired if the carrying value (original cost\nless accumulated depreciation) is greater than the asset's future undiscounted cash flow\nstream. Because the recoverability test is based on estimates of future undiscounted cash\nflows, tests for impairment involve considerable management discretion.\nLoss measurement. If impaired, the asset's value is written down to fair value on the\nbalance sheet and a loss, equal to the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the\nasset (or the discounted value of its future cash flows if the fair value is not known), is\nrecognized in the income statement.\n"}
