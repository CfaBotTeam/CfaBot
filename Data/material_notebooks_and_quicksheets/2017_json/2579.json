{"id": "2579", "text": "Investors can use a variety of equity market indexes. These equity indexes can be\nclassified as follows:\nBroad market index. Provides a measure of a market's overall performance and usually\ncontains more than 90% of the market's total value. For example, the Wilshire\n5000 Index contains more than 6,000 equity securities and is, therefore, a good\nrepresentation of the overall performance of the U.S. equity market.\nMulti-market index. Typically constructed from the indexes of markets in several\ncountries and is used to measure the equity returns of a geographic region (e.g.,\nLatin America indexes), markets based on their stage of economic development (e.g.,\nemerging markets indexes), or the entire world (e.g., MSCI World Index).\nMulti-market index with fundamental weighting. Uses market capitalizationweighting for the country indexes but then weights the country index returns in\nthe global index by a fundamental factor (e.g., GDP). This prevents a country with\npreviously high stock returns from being overweighted in a multi-market index.\n"}
