{"id": 539, "text": "As you will soon see, a test statistic is a random variable that may follow one of several\ndistributions, depending on the characteristics of the sample and the population. We\nwill look at four distributions for test statistics: the t-distribution, the z-distribution\n(standard normal distribution), the chi-square distribution, and the F-distribution. The\ncritical value for the appropriate test statistic\u2014the value against which the computed\ntest statistic is compared\u2014depends on its distribution.\n"}
