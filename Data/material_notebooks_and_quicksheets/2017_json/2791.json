In an infinite-period DDM model, the present value\nof all expected future dividends is calculated and there is no explicit terminal value for\nthe stock. In practice, as we will see, a terminal value can be calculated at a time in the\nfuture after which the growth rate of dividends is expected to be constant.\n"}
