{"id": 2641, "text": "Earnings announcements. An earnings surprise is that portion of announced earnings\nthat was not expected by the market. Positive earnings surprises (earnings higher than\nexpected) precede periods of positive risk-adjusted post-announcement stock returns,\nand negative surprises lead to predictable negative risk-adjusted returns. The anomaly is\nthat the adjustment process does not occur entirely on the announcement day. Investors\ncould exploit this anomaly by buying positive earnings surprise firms and selling negative\nearnings surprise firms. Some researchers argue that evidence of predictable abnormal\nreturns after earnings surprises is a result of estimating risk-adjusted returns incorrectly\nin the tests and that transactions costs would eliminate any abnormal profits from\nattempting to exploit this returns anomaly.\n"}
