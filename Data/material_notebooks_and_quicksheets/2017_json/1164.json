{"id": "1164", "text": "Ricardo argued that, in the absence of trading costs, England could trade cloth for wine\nand, by doing so, get wine for 100 instead of 110. Portugal would get cloth for 80 (the\ncost in Portugal of the traded wine), and both countries would be better off. Note that\nPortugal has an absolute advantage in the production of both goods but a comparative\nadvantage in the production of wine. In England, the opportunity cost of one unit of\nwine is 110 / 100 = 1.10 units of cloth. In Portugal, the opportunity cost of one unit of\nwine is 80 / 90 = 0.89 units of cloth.\n"}
