{"id": "3916", "text": "LOS 54.c\nAsset-backed securities (ABS) can be a single class of securities or multiple classes with\ndiffering claims to the cash flows from the underlying assets. Time tranching refers to\nclasses that receive the principal payments from underlying securities sequentially as each\nprior tranche is repaid in full. With credit tranching, any credit losses are first absorbed\nby the tranche with the lowest priority, and after that by any other subordinated\ntranches, in order. Some structures have both time tranching and credit tranching.\n"}
