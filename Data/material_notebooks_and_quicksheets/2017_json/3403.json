{"id": "3403", "text": "We can separate these payments into a known payment and three unknown payments\nwhich are equivalent to the payments on three forward rate agreements. Let S, represent\nthe floating rate payment (based on 90-day Libor) owed at the end of quarter n and F.\nbe the fixed payment owed at the end of quarter n. We can represent the swap payment\nto be received by the fixed rate payer at the end of period n as S, -F.. We can replicate\neach of these payments to (or from) the fixed rate payer in the swap with a forward\ncontract, specifically a long position in a forward rate agreement with a contract rate\nequal to the swap fixed rate and a settlement value based on 90-day Libor.\n"}
