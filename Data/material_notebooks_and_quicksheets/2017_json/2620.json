{"id": "2620", "text": "Impediments to trading. Arbitrage refers to buying an asset in one market and\nsimultaneously selling it at a higher price in another market. This buying and selling\nof assets will continue until the prices in the two markets are equal. Impediments to\narbitrage, such as high transactions costs or lack of information, will limit arbitrage\nactivity and allow some price inefficiencies (i.e., mispricing of assets) to persist.\nShort selling improves market efficiency. The sales pressure from short selling prevents\nassets from becoming overvalued. Restrictions on short selling, such as an inability to\nborrow stock cheaply, can reduce market efficiency.\nTransaction and information costs. To the extent that the costs of information, analysis,\nand trading are greater than the potential profit from trading misvalued securities,\nmarket prices will be inefficient. It is generally accepted that markets are efficient if, after\ndeducting costs, there are no risk-adjusted returns to be made from trading based on\npublicly available information.\n"}
