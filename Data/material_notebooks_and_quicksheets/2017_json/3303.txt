{"id": 3303, "text": "5. Monetary flexibility includes the ability to use monetary policy for domestic\neconomic objectives (this might be lacking with exchange rate targeting or\nmembership in a monetary union) and the credibility and effectiveness of monetary\npolicy.\nCredit rating agencies assign each national government two ratings: (1) a local currency\ndebt rating and (2) a foreign currency debt rating. The ratings are assigned separately\nbecause defaults on foreign currency denominated debt have historically exceeded those\non local currency debt. Foreign currency debt typically has a higher default rate and\na lower credit rating because the government must purchase foreign currency in the\nopen market to make interest and principal payments, which exposes it to the risk of\nsignificant local currency depreciation. In contrast, local currency debt can be repaid by\nraising taxes, controlling domestic spending, or simply printing more money. Ratings\ncan differ as much as two notches for local and foreign currency bonds.\nSovereign defaults can be caused by events such as war, political instability, severe\ndevaluation of the currency, or large declines in the prices of the country's export\ncommodities. Access to debt markets can be difficult for sovereigns in bad economic\ntimes.\n"}
