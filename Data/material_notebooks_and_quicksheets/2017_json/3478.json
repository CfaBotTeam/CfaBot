{"id": 3478, "text": "Call Option Profits and Losses\nConsider a call option with a premium of $5 and a strike price of $50. This means the\nbuyer pays $5 to the writer. At expiration, if the price of the stock is less than or equal\nto the $50 strike price (the option has zero value), the buyer of the option is out $5, and\nthe writer of the option is ahead $5. As the stock's price exceeds $50, the buyer of the\noption starts to gain (breakeven will come at $55, when the value of the stock equals the\nstrike price and the option premium). However, as the price of the stock moves upward,\nthe seller of the option starts to lose (negative figures will start at $55, when the value of\nthe stock equals the strike price and the option premium).\n"}
