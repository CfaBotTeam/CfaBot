{"id": "3371", "text": "For most risky assets, we estimate current value as the discounted present value of the\nexpected price of the asset at some future time. Because the future price is subject to risk\n(uncertainty), the discount rate includes a risk premium along with the risk-free rate.\nThere may be costs of owning an asset, such as storage and insurance costs. For financial\nassets, these costs are very low and not significant. The other important cost of holding\nan asset is the opportunity cost of the funds that are invested in the asset, which we\nusually measure as the asset cost times the risk-free rate, compounded over the holding\nperiod.\n"}
