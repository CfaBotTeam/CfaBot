{"id": "1526", "text": "LOS 16.)\nIn long-run equilibrium, real GDP is equal to full-employment (potential) GDP. An\nincrease in aggregate demand can result in a short-run equilibrium with GDP greater\nthan full-employment GDP, termed an inflationary gap. A decrease in aggregate demand\ncan result in a short-run equilibrium with GDP less than full-employment, termed\na recessionary gap. When short-run aggregate supply decreases, the resulting shortrun equilibrium is with GDP reduced to less than full-employment GDP but with an\nincrease in the price level, termed stagflation.\nLOS 16.k\nFrom a situation of long-run equilibrium: an increase in either aggregate demand or\naggregate supply can result in a short-run equilibrium with real GDP greater than full\nemployment GDP; a decrease in either aggregate demand or aggregate supply can result\nin a short-run equilibrium with real GDP less than full-employment GDP.\nLOS 16.1\nShort-run effects of shifts in both aggregate demand and aggregate supply on the price\nlevel and real GDP:\n"}
