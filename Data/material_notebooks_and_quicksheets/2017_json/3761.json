{"id": "3761", "text": "Yield Measures for Fixed-Rate Bonds\nWe have previously covered the coupon rate and yield-to-maturity for fixed-rate bonds.\nThe effective yield for a bond depends on how many coupon payments are made each\nyear and is simply the compound return. How frequently coupon payments are made is\nreferred to as the periodicity of the annual rate.\nAn annual-pay bond with an 8% YTM has an effective yield of 8%.\nA semiannual-pay bond (periodicity of two) with an 8% YTM has a yield of 4% every\nsix months and an effective yield of 1.042 - 1 = 8.16%.\n"}
