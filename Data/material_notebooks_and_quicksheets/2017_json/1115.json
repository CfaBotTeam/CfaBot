{"id": "1115", "text": "Action lag: The time governments take to discuss, vote on, and enact fiscal policy\nchanges.\nImpact lag: The time between the enactment of fiscal policy changes and when\nthe impact of the changes on the economy actually takes place. It takes time for\ncorporations and individuals to act on the fiscal policy changes, and fiscal multiplier\neffects occur only over time as well.\nThese lags can actually make fiscal policy counterproductive. For example, if the\neconomy is in a recession phase, fiscal stimulus may be deemed appropriate. However, by\nthe time fiscal stimulus is implemented and has its full impact, the economy may already\nbe on a path to a recovery driven by the private sector.\n"}
