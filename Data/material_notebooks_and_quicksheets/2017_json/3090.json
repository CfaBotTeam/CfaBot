{"id": 3090, "text": "Stock dividends are dividends paid out in new shares of stock rather than cash. In\nthis case, there will be more shares outstanding, but each one will be worth less. Stock\ndividends are commonly expressed as a percentage. A 20% stock dividend means every\nshareholder gets 20% more stock. On the firm's balance sheet, issuing a stock dividend\ndecreases retained earnings and increases contributed capital by the same amount. Total\nshareholders' equity remains unchanged.\n"}
