{"id": 2980, "text": "How a company raises capital and how it budgets or invests it are considered\nindependently. Most companies have separate departments for the two tasks. The financing\ndepartment is responsible for keeping costs low and using a balance of funding sources:\ncommon equity, preferred stock, and debt. Generally, it is necessary to raise each type\nof capital in large sums. The large sums may temporarily overweight the most recently\nissued capital, but in the long run, the firm will adhere to target weights. Because of these\nand other financing considerations, each investment decision must be made assuming a\nWACC, which includes each of the different sources of capital and is based on the longrun target weights. A company creates value by producing a return on assets that is higher\nthan the required rate of return on the capital needed to fund those assets.\n"}
