The use of\nthe direct method, however, is encouraged by both standard setters. Regrettably, most\nfirms use the indirect method. The difference between the two methods relates to the\npresentation of cash flow from operating activities. The presentation of cash flows from\ninvesting activities and financing activities is exactly the same under both methods.\n"}
