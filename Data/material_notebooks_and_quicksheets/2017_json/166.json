{"id": 166, "text": "Measures of Sample Skew and Kurtosis\nSample skewness is equal to the sum of the cubed deviations from the mean divided by\nthe cubed standard deviation and by the number of observations. Sample skewness for\nlarge samples is computed as:\n2(x; -x)\nsample skewness (SK) ==\nwhere:\ns = sample standard deviation\nNote that the denominator is always positive, but that the numerator can be positive or\nnegative, depending on whether observations above the mean or observations below the\nmean tend to be further from the mean on average. When a distribution is right skewed,\n"}
