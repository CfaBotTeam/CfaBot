A decrease in days of inventory would decrease the operating\ncycle.\n3. C Primary sources of liquidity include ready cash balances, short-term funds\n(e.g., short-term investment portfolios), and cash flow management. Secondary\nsources of liquidity include negotiating debt contracts, liquidating assets, and filing for\nbankruptcy protection and reorganization.\n4. A The goal of managing the net daily cash position is to ensure that adequate cash is\navailable to prevent the firm from having to arrange financing on short notice (and thus\nat high cost), while earning a return on cash balances when they are temporarily high\nby investing in short-term securities. A firm can meet this goal by forecasting its cash\ninflows and outflows to identify periods when its cash balance is expected to be lower or\nhigher than needed. \"Minimizing uninvested cash balances\u201d is inaccurate because a firm\nshould maintain some target amount of available cash.\n5. B The actual discount on the acceptance is (26,500 \u2013 25,400) / 26,500 = 4.151%. The\nannualized discount, or discount-basis yield, is 4.151(360/80) = 18.68%.\nThe holding period yield is (26,500 \u2013 25,400) / 25,400 = 4.331%. The bond equivalent\nyield is 4.331(365/80) = 19.76%.\n6. B Large firms with good credit have access to the commercial paper market and can\nget lower financing costs with commercial paper than they can with bank borrowing.\nBankers' acceptances are used by companies involved in international trade. Factoring of\nreceivables is a higher-cost source of funds and is used more by smaller firms that do not\nhave particularly strong credit.\n"}
