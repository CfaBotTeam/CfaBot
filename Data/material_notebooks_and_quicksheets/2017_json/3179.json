{"id": 3179, "text": "The second approach is typically used in practice. Using the durations of individual\nportfolio bonds makes it possible to calculate the duration for a portfolio that contains\nbonds with embedded options by using their effective durations. The weights for the\ncalculation of portfolio duration under this approach are simply the full price of each\nbond as a proportion of the total portfolio value (using full prices). These proportions of\ntotal portfolio value are multiplied by the corresponding bond durations to get portfolio\nduration.\n"}
