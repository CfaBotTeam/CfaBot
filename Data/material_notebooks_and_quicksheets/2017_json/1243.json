{"id": "1243", "text": "USD/EUR spot = $1.312 USD/EUR 90-day forward = $1.320\nThe (90-day) forward premium or discount on the euro = forward/spot \u2014 1 =\n1.320/1.312 - 1 = 0.609%. Because this is positive, it is interpreted as a forward\npremium on the euro of 0.609%. Since we have the forward rate for 3 months, we could\nannualize the discount simply by multiplying by (12/3=) 4.\n"}
