{"id": 456, "text": "The result of the preceding two examples illustrates an important property of sampling\ndistributions. Notice that the value of the standard error of the sample mean decreased\nfrom 3.6% to 1.4% as the sample size increased from 30 to 200. This is because as the\nsample size increases, the sample mean gets closer, on average, to the true mean of the\npopulation. In other words, the distribution of the sample means about the population\nmean gets smaller and smaller, so the standard error of the sample mean decreases.\n"}
