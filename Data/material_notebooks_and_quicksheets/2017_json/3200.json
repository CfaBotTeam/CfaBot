{"id": 3200, "text": "Example: Estimating price changes with duration and convexity\nConsider an 8% bond with a full price of $908 and a YTM of 9%. Estimate the\npercentage change in the full price of the bond for a 30 basis point increase in YTM\nassuming the bond's duration is 9.42 and its convexity is 68.33.\nAnswer:\nThe duration effect is \u20139.42 x 0.003 = 0.02826 = -2.826%.\n"}
