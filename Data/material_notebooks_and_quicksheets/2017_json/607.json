{"id": 607, "text": "where:\nn = sample size\ns2 = sample variance\no\u1ed1 = hypothesized value for the population variance.\nSimilar to other hypothesis tests, the chi-square test compares the test statistic, X\u00e1-1, to\na critical chi-square value at a given level of significance and n - 1 degrees of freedom.\nNote that since the chi-square distribution is bounded below by zero, chi-square values\ncannot be negative.\nExample: Chi-square test for a single population variance\nHistorically, High-Return Equity Fund has advertised that its monthly returns have\na standard deviation equal to 4%. This was based on estimates from the 1990-1998\nperiod. High-Return wants to verify whether this claim still adequately describes the\nstandard deviation of the fund's returns. High-Return collected monthly returns for\nthe 24-month period between 1998 and 2000 and measured a standard deviation of\nmonthly returns of 3.8%. Determine if the more recent standard deviation is different\nfrom the advertised standard deviation.\n"}
