Firms must prioritize profitable projects\naccording to the timing of the project's cash flows, available company\nresources, and the company's overall strategic plan. Many projects that are\nattractive individually may not make sense strategically.\nStep 4: Monitoring decisions and conducting a post-audit. It is important to follow\nup on all capital budgeting decisions. An analyst should compare the actual\nresults to the projected results, and project managers should explain why\nprojections did or did not match actual performance. Because the capital\nbudgeting process is only as good as the estimates of the inputs into the model\nused to forecast cash flows, a post-audit should be used to identify systematic\nerrors in the forecasting process and improve company operations.\n"}
