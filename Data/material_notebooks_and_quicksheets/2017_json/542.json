{"id": "542", "text": "The Power of a Test\nWhile the significance level of a test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis\nwhen it is true, the power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null\nhypothesis when it is false. The power of a test is actually one minus the probability\nof making a Type II error, or 1 - P(Type II error). In other words, the probability of\nrejecting the null when it is false (power of the test) equals one minus the probability of\nnot rejecting the null when it is false (Type II error). When more than one test statistic\nmay be used, the power of the test for the competing test statistics may be useful in\ndeciding which test statistic to use. Ordinarily, we wish to use the test statistic that\nprovides the most powerful test among all possible tests.\n"}
