{"id": 645, "text": "Ralph Rollins, a researcher, believes that the stocks of firms that have appeared\nin a certain financial newspaper with a positive headline and story return more\non a risk-adjusted basis. He gathers data on the risk-adjusted returns for these\nstocks over the six months after they appear on the cover, and data on the riskadjusted returns for an equal-sized sample of firms with characteristics similar to\nthe cover-story firms matched by time period.\nA. State the likely null and alternative hypotheses for a test of his belief.\nB.\nIs this a one- or two-tailed test?\nDescribe the steps in testing a hypothesis such as the null you stated in\npart A.\nFor each of the following hypotheses, describe the appropriate test, identify the\nappropriate test statistic, and explain under what conditions the null hypothesis\nshould be rejected.\nA.\nA researcher has returns over 52 weeks for an index of natural gas\nstocks and for an index of oil stocks and wants to know if the weekly\nreturns are equal. Assume that the returns are approximately normally\ndistributed.\nB.\nA researcher has two independent samples that are approximately\nnormally distributed. She wishes to test whether the mean values of\nthe two random variables are equal and assumes that the variances of\nthe populations from which the two samples are drawn are equal. As\nan additional question here, how should the degrees of freedom be\ncalculated?\nA researcher wants to determine whether the population variances of\ntwo normally distributed random variables are equal based on two\nsamples of sizes n, and n,. As an additional question here, how should\nthe degrees of freedom be calculated?\nA researcher wants to test whether the variance of a normally distributed\npopulation is equal to 0.00165. As an additional question here, how\nshould the degrees of freedom be calculated?\n"}
