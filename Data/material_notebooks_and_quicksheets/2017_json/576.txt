{"id": 576, "text": "Collect the sample and calculate the test statistic. The value of x from the sample is\n2.49. Since o is given as 0.021, we calculate the z-statistic using o as follows:\n_- Po 2.49 \u2013 2.5-0.01\no/vn 0.021/ /49 0.003\nMake a decision regarding the hypothesis. The calculated value of the z-statistic is\n-3.33. Since this value is less than the critical value, -20.025 = -1.96, it falls in the\nrejection region in the left tail of the z-distribution. Hence, there is sufficient evidence\nto reject H,.\n"}
