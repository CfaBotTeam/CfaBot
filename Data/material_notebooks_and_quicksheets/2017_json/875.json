{"id": "875", "text": "Please recognize that the cash flows occur at the end of the period depicted on the time\nline. Furthermore, note that the end of one period is the same as the beginning of the\nnext period. For example, the end of the second year (t = 2) is the same as the beginning\nof the third year, so a cash flow at the beginning of Year 3 appears at time t = 2 on the\ntime line. Keeping this convention in mind will help you keep things straight when you\nare setting up TVM problems.\n"}
