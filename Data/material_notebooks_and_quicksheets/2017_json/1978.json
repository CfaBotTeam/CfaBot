{"id": "1978", "text": "EXAM Focus\nThe analysis of financial statements requires an understanding of how a company's\ntransactions are recorded in the various accounts. Candidates should focus on the\nfinancial statement elements (assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, and expenses) and\nbe able to classify any account into its appropriate element. Candidates should also\nlearn the basic and expanded accounting equations and why every transaction must be\nrecorded in at least two accounts. The types of accruals, when each of them is used, how\nchanges in accounts affect the financial statements, and the relationships among the\nfinancial statements, are all important topics.\n"}
