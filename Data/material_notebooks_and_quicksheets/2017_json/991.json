{"id": 991, "text": "Because labor is the most important cost of production, wage pressure can be a source\nof cost-push inflation (sometimes called wage-push inflation when it occurs). Upward\npressure on wages is more likely to emerge when cyclical unemployment is low, but\nit can occur even when cyclical unemployment is present. Because every individual\nprovides a different type and quality of labor, some segments of the economy may have\ntrouble finding enough qualified workers even during a contraction. As a result, the\nnon-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), also called the natural rate\nof unemployment (NARU), can be higher than the rate associated with the absence of\ncyclical unemployment. NARU or NAIRU can vary over time and is likely different\nacross countries.\nAnalysts can use publicly available data on hourly and weekly earnings and labor\nproductivity to identify signs of potential wage pressure. Wage increases are not\ninflationary as long as they remain in line with gains in productivity. A useful indicator\nof wages and benefits in terms of productivity is unit labor costs, the ratio of total labor\ncompensation per hour to output units per hour.\n"}
