{"id": "363", "text": "The continuous uniform distribution is defined over a range that spans between\nsome lower limit, a, and some upper limit, b, which serve as the parameters of the\ndistribution. Outcomes can only occur between a and b, and since we are dealing with\na continuous distribution, even if a <x< b, P(X = x) = 0. Formally, the properties of a\ncontinuous uniform distribution may be described as follows:\n\u2022 For all a <X| < x < b (i.e., for all x, and x, between the boundaries a and b).\nP(X < a or X > b) = 0 (i.e., the probability of X outside the boundaries is zero).\nP(x, <X< x) = (x, -x,)/(b - a). This defines the probability of outcomes between\nx, and x2.\n\u00a92016 Kaplan, Inc.\n"}
