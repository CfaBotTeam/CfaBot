{"id": "2334", "text": "The assumptions of the CAPM are:\n\u2022 Risk aversion. To accept a greater degree of risk, investors require a higher expected\nreturn.\nUtility maximizing investors. Investors choose the portfolio, based on their individual\npreferences, with the risk and return combination that maximizes their (expected)\nutility.\nFrictionless markets. There are no taxes, transaction costs, or other impediments to\ntrading.\nOne-period horizon. All investors have the same one-period time horizon.\nHomogeneous expectations. All investors have the same expectations for assets\nexpected returns, standard deviation of returns, and returns correlations between\nassets.\nDivisible assets. All investments are infinitely divisible.\nCompetitive markets. Investors take the market price as given and no investor can\ninfluence prices with their trades.\n"}
