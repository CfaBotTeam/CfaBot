{"id": "3059", "text": "Professor's Note: Look back at the formulas for DOL and DFL and convince\nyourself that if there are no fixed costs, DOL is equal to one, and that if there\nare no interest costs, DFL is equal to one. Values of one mean no leverage. No\nfixed costs, no operating leverage. No interest costs, no financial leverage. This\nshould help tie these formulas to the concepts and help you know when you have\nthe formulas right (or wrong). If you plug in zero for fixed costs, DOL should be\none, and if you plug in zero for interest, DFL should be one.\n"}
