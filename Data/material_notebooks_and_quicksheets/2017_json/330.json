{"id": 330, "text": "The probabilities of each outcome are as follows:\nP(increase and development) = (0.25)(0.70) = 0.175.\nP(increase and no development) = (0.25)(0.30) = 0.075.\nP(no increase and development) = (0.75)(0.20) = 0.15.\nP(no increase and no development) = (0.75)(0.80) = 0.60.\nWe want to update the probability of an increase in orders, given the new information\nthat the builder is starting the development. We can apply Bayes' formula:\nP(development | increase) x P(increase)\nP(increase | development) = -\nP(development)\nFrom our assumptions, P(development | increase) = 0.70, and P(increase) = 0.25, so the\nnumerator is (0.70) (0.25) = 0.175.\n"}
