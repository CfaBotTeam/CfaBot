{"id": "2778", "text": "Recall from the topic review of Market Efficiency that intrinsic value or fundamental\nvalue is defined as the rational value investors would place on the asset if they had full\nknowledge of the asset's characteristics. Analysts use valuation models to estimate the\nintrinsic values of stocks and compare them to the stocks' market prices to determine\nwhether individual stocks are overvalued, undervalued, or fairly valued. In doing\nvaluation analysis for stocks, analysts are assuming that some stocks' prices deviate\nsignificantly from their intrinsic values.\n"}
