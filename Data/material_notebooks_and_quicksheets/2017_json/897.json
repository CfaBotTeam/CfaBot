{"id": 897, "text": "An annuity is a stream of equal cash flows that occurs at equal intervals over a given\nperiod. Receiving $1,000 per year at the end of each of the next eight years is an example\nof an annuity. There are two types of annuities: ordinary annuities and annuities due.\nThe ordinary annuity is the most common type of annuity. It is characterized by cash\nflows that occur at the end of each compounding period. This is a typical cash flow\npattern for many investment and business finance applications. The other type of\nannuity is called an annuity due, where payments or receipts occur at the beginning of\neach period (i.e., the first payment is today at t= 0).\nComputing the FV or PV of an annuity with your calculator is no more difficult than it\nis for a single cash flow. You will know four of the five relevant variables and solve for the\nfifth (either PV or FV). The difference between single sum and annuity TVM problems\nis that instead of solving for the PV or FV of a single cash flow, we solve for the PV or\nFV of a stream of equal periodic cash flows, where the size of the periodic cash flow is\ndefined by the payment (PMT) variable on your calculator.\n"}
