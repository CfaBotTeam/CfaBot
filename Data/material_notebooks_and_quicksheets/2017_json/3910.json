{"id": "3910", "text": "A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is a structured security issued by an SPE for\nwhich the collateral is a pool of debt obligations. When the collateral securities are\ncorporate and emerging market debt, they are called collateralized bond obligations\n(CBO). Collateralized loan obligations (CLO) are supported by a portfolio of leveraged\nbank loans. Unlike the ABS we have discussed, CDOs do not rely on interest payments\nfrom the collateral pool. CDOs have a collateral manager who buys and sells securities\nin the collateral pool in order to generate the cash to make the promised payments to\ninvestors.\n"}
