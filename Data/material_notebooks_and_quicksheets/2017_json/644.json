F-test.\nC. x2 test.\nWilliam Adams wants to test whether the mean monthly returns over the last\nfive years are the same for two stocks. If he assumes that the returns distributions\nare normal and have equal variances, the type of test and test statistic are best\ndescribed as:\nA. paired comparisons test, t-statistic.\nB. paired comparisons test, F-statistic.\nC. difference in means test, t-statistic.\nWhich of the following assumptions is least likely required for the difference in\nmeans test based on two samples?\nA. The two samples are independent.\nB. The two populations are normally distributed.\nC. The two populations have equal variances.\nFor a hypothesis test with a probability of a Type II error of 60% and a\nprobability of a Type I error of 5%, which of the following statements is most\naccurate?\nA. The power of the test is 40%, and there is a 5% probability that the test\nstatistic will exceed the critical value(s).\nB. There is a 95% probability that the test statistic will be between the critical\nvalues if this is a two-tailed test.\nC. There is a 5% probability that the null hypothesis will be rejected when\nactually true, and the probability of rejecting the null when it is false is\n40%.\nFor more questions related to this topic review, log in to your Schweser online account and\nlaunch SchweserPro TM QBank; and for video instruction covering each LOS in this topic\nreview, log in to your Schweser online account and launch the OnDemand video lectures, if\nyou have purchased these products.\n"}
