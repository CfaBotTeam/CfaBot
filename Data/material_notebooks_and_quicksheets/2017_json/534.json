{"id": 534, "text": "The Choice of the Null and Alternative Hypotheses\nThe most common null hypothesis will be an \u201cequal to\u201d hypothesis. Combined with a\n\u201cnot equal to\u201d alternative, this will require a two-tailed test. The alternative is often the\nhoped-for hypothesis. When the null is that a coefficient is equal to zero, we hope to\nreject it and show the significance of the relationship.\nWhen the null is less than or equal to, the (mutually exclusive) alternative is framed as\ngreater than, and a one-tail test is appropriate. If we are trying to demonstrate that a\nreturn is greater than the risk-free rate, this would be the correct formulation. We will\nhave set up the null and alternative hypothesis so that rejection of the null will lead to\nacceptance of the alternative, our goal in performing the test.\n"}
