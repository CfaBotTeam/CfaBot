{"id": 3402, "text": "In a simple interest-rate swap, one party pays a floating rate and the other pays a fixed\nrate on a notional principal amount. Consider a one-year swap with quarterly payments,\none party paying a fixed rate and the other a floating rate of 90-day Libor. At each\npayment date the difference between the swap fixed rate and Libor (for the prior 90\ndays) is paid to the party that owes the least, that is, a net payment is made from one\nparty to the other.\n"}
