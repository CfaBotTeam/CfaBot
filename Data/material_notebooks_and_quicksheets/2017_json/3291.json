{"id": "3291", "text": "Corporate structure. Many high-yield companies use a holding company structure. A\nparent company receives dividends from the earnings of subsidiaries as its primary source\nof operating income. Because of structural subordination, subsidiaries' dividends paid\nupstream to a parent company are subordinate to interest payments. These dividends can\nbe insufficient to pay the debt obligations of the parent, thus reducing the recovery rate\nfor debt holders of the parent company.\n"}
