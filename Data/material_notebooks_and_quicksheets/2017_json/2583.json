{"id": 2583, "text": "Hedge funds pool investor money and invest in nontraditional assets, using leverage\n(borrowed money or derivative contracts) and both long and short positions. Most\nhedge fund indexes equally weight the returns of the hedge funds included in the index.\nHedge funds are largely unregulated and are not required to report their performance to\nindex providers. Consequently, some funds will report to one index but not another. The\nperformance of different indexes can thus vary substantially.\n"}
