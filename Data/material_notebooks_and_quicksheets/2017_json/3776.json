{"id": "3776", "text": "We call the margin used to calculate the bond coupon payments the quoted margin\nand we call the margin required to return the FRN to its par value the required margin\n(also called the discount margin). When the credit quality of an FRN is unchanged, the\nquoted margin is equal to the required margin and the FRN returns to its par value at\neach reset date when the next coupon payment is reset to the current market rate (plus\nor minus the appropriate margin).\nIf the credit quality of the issuer decreases, the quoted margin will be less than the\nrequired margin and the FRN will sell at a discount to its par value. If credit quality has\nimproved, the quoted margin will be greater than the required margin and the FRN will\nsell at a premium to its par value.\nA somewhat simplified way of calculating the value of an FRN on a reset date is to use\nthe current reference rate plus the quoted margin to estimate the future cash flows for\nthe FRN and to discount these future cash flows at the reference rate plus the required\n(discount) margin. The following example illustrates this method. There are more\ncomplex models that produce better estimates of value.\n"}
