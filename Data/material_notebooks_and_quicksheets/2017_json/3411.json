{"id": "3411", "text": "As with forward rate agreements, the price of a swap is the fixed rate of interest specified\nin the swap contract (the contract rate) and the value depends on how expected future\nfloating rates change over time. At initiation, a swap has zero value because the present\nvalue of the fixed-rate payments equals the present value of the expected floating-rate\npayments. An increase in expected short-term future rates will produce a positive value\nfor the fixed-rate payer in an interest rate swap, and a decrease in expected future rates\nwill produce a negative value because the promised fixed rate payments have more value\nthan the expected floating rate payments over the life of the swap.\n"}
