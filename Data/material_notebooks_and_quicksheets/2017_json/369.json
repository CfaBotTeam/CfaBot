{"id": 369, "text": "The Role of Correlation in the Multivariate Normal Distribution\nSimilar to a univariate normal distribution, a multivariate normal distribution can be\ndescribed by the mean and variance of the individual random variables. Additionally,\nit is necessary to specify the correlation between the individual pairs of variables when\ndescribing a multivariate distribution. Correlation is the feature that distinguishes a\nmultivariate distribution from a univariate normal distribution. Correlation indicates the\nstrength of the linear relationship between a pair of random variables.\nUsing asset returns as our random variables, the multivariate normal distribution for the\nreturns on n assets can be completely defined by the following three sets of parameters:\n\u2022 n means of the n series of returns (1, 2, ..., 1).\n\u2022 n variances of the n series of returns (of, oz, ..., 6;).\n\u2022 0.5n(n - 1) pair-wise correlations.\nFor example, if there are two assets, n = 2, then the multivariate returns distribution\ncan be described with two means, two variances, and one correlation [0.5(2)(2 - 1) =\n1]. If there are four assets, n = 4, the multivariate distribution can be described with\nfour means, four variances, and six correlations [0.5(4)(4 - 1) = 6]. When building a\nportfolio of assets, all other things being equal, it is desirable to combine assets having\nlow returns correlation because this will result in a portfolio with a lower variance than\none composed of assets with higher correlations.\n"}
