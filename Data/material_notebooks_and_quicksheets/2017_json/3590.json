{"id": "3590", "text": "fixed but includes a lump-sum payment based on the present value of the future coupons\nthe bondholder will not receive if the bond is called early.\nWith a make-whole call provision, the calculated call price is unlikely to be lower than\nthe market value of the bond. Therefore the issuer is unlikely to call the bond except\nwhen corporate circumstances, such as an acquisition or restructuring, require it. The\nmake-whole provision does not put an upper limit on bond values when interest rates\nfall as does a regular call provision. The make-whole provision actually penalizes the\nissuer for calling the bond. The net effect is that the bond can be called if necessary, but\nit can also be issued at a lower yield than a bond with a traditional call provision.\n"}
