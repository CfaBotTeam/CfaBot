{"id": "2349", "text": "When we evaluate the performance of a portfolio with risk that differs from that of a\nbenchmark, we need to adjust the portfolio returns for the risk of the portfolio. There\nare several measures of risk-adjusted returns that are used to evaluate relative portfolio\nperformance.\nOne such measure is the Sharpe ratio\nRp \u2013 Re.\nop)\nThe Sharpe ratio of a portfolio is its excess returns per unit of total portfolio risk, and\nhigher Sharpe ratios indicate better risk-adjusted portfolio performance. Note that this\nis a slope measure and, as illustrated in Figure 9, the Sharpe ratios of all portfolios along\nthe CML are the same. Because the Sharpe ratio uses total risk, rather than systematic\nrisk, it accounts for any unsystematic risk that the portfolio manager has taken. Note\nthat the value of the Sharpe ratio is only useful for comparison with the Sharpe ratio of\nanother portfolio.\n"}
