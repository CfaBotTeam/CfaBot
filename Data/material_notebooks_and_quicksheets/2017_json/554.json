{"id": 554, "text": "The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic that would lead to a rejection\nof the null hypothesis, assuming the null hypothesis is true. It is the smallest level of\nsignificance for which the null hypothesis can be rejected. For one-tailed tests, the\np-value is the probability that lies above the computed test statistic for upper tail tests\nor below the computed test statistic for lower tail tests. For two-tailed tests, the p-value\nis the probability that lies above the positive value of the computed test statistic plus the\nprobability that lies below the negative value of the computed test statistic.\n"}
