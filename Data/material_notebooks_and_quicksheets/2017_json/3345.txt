{"id": 3345, "text": "In the futures markets, margin is money that must be deposited by both the long and\nthe short as a performance guarantee prior to entering into a futures contract. Unlike\nmargin in bond or stock accounts, there is no loan involved and, consequently, no\ninterest charges. This provides protection for the clearinghouse. Each day, the margin\nbalance in a futures account is adjusted for any gains and losses in the value of the\nfutures position based on the new settlement price, a process called the mark to market\nor marking to market. Initial margin is the amount that must be deposited in a futures\naccount before a trade may be made. Initial margin per contract is relatively low and\nequals about one day's maximum price fluctuation on the total value of the assets\ncovered by the contract.\n"}
