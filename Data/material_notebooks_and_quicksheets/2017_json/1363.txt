{"id": 1363, "text": "Figure 11 illustrates the differences between long-run equilibrium in markets with\nmonopolistic competition and markets with perfect competition. Note that with\nmonopolistic competition, price is greater than marginal cost (i.e., producers can\nrealize a markup), average total cost is not at a minimum for the quantity produced\n(suggesting excess capacity, or an inefficient scale of production), and the price is\nslightly higher than under perfect competition. The point to consider here, however, is\nthat perfect competition is characterized by no product differentiation. The question of\nthe efficiency of monopolistic competition becomes, \u201cIs there an economically efficient\namount of product differentiation?\u201d\n"}
