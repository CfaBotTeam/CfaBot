{"id": 496, "text": "Potential mistakes in the sampling method can bias results. These biases include data\nmining (significant relationships that have occurred by chance), sample selection bias\n(selection is non-random), look-ahead bias (basing the test at a point in time on data\nnot available at that time), survivorship bias (using only surviving mutual funds, hedge\nfunds, etc.), and time-period bias (the relation does not hold over other time periods).\n"}
