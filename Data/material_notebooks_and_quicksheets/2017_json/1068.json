{"id": "1068", "text": "For a central bank to succeed in its inflation-targeting policies, it should have three\nessential qualities:\n1. Independence: For a central bank to be effective in achieving its goals, it should be\nfree from political interference. Reducing the money supply to reduce inflation can\nalso be expected to decrease economic growth and employment. The political party\nin power has an incentive to boost economic activity and reduce unemployment\nprior to elections. For this reason, politicians may interfere with the central bank's\nactivities, compromising its ability to manage inflation. Independence should be\nthought of in relative terms (degrees of independence) rather than absolute terms.\nEven in the case of relatively independent central banks, the heads of the banks may\nbe appointed by politicians.\nIndependence can be evaluated based on both operational independence and target\nindependence. Operational independence means that the central bank is allowed\nto independently determine the policy rate. Target independence means the central\nbank also defines how inflation is computed, sets the target inflation level, and\ndetermines the horizon over which the target is to be achieved. The ECB has both\ntarget and operational independence, while most other central banks have only\noperational independence.\n"}
