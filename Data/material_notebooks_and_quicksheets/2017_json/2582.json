{"id": "2582", "text": "Commodity indexes represent futures contracts on commodities such as grains,\nlivestock, metals, and energy. Examples include the Commodity Research Bureau Index\nand the S&P GSCI (previously the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index).\nThe issues in commodity indexes relevant for investors are as follows:\nWeighting method. Commodity index providers use a variety of weighting schemes.\nSome use equal weighting, others weight commodities by their global production\nvalues, and others use fixed weights that the index provider determines. As a result,\ndifferent indexes have significantly different commodity exposures and risk and\nreturn characteristics. For example, one index may have a large exposure to the\nprices of energy commodities while another has a large exposure to the prices of\nagricultural products.\nFutures vs. actual. Commodity indexes are based on the prices of commodity futures\ncontracts, not the spot prices of commodities. Commodity futures contracts reflect\nthe risk-free rate of return, changes in futures prices, and the roll yield. Furthermore,\nthe contracts mature and must be replaced over time by other contracts. For these\nreasons, the return on commodity futures differs from the returns on a long position\nin the commodity itself.\nReal estate indexes can be constructed using returns based on appraisals of properties,\nrepeat property sales, or the performance of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS).\nREITs are similar to closed-end mutual funds in that they invest in properties or\nmortgages and then issue ownership interests in the pool of assets to investors. While\nreal properties are quite illiquid, REIT shares trade like any common shares and many\noffer very good liquidity to investors. FTSE International produces a family of REIT\nindexes.\n"}
