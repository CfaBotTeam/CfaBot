{"id": 3503, "text": "A call option gives the issuer the right to redeem all or part of a bond issue at a specific\nprice (call price) if they choose to. As an example of a call provision, consider a 6% 20year bond issued at par on June 1, 2012, for which the indenture includes the following\ncall schedule:\nThe bonds can be redeemed by the issuer at 102% of par after June 1, 2017.\nThe bonds can be redeemed by the issuer at 101% of par after June 1, 2020.\n\u2022 The bonds can be redeemed by the issuer at 100% of par after June 1, 2022.\nFor the 5-year period from the issue date until June 2017, the bond is not callable. We\nsay the bond has five years of call protection, or that the bond is call protected for\nfive years. This 5-year period is also referred to as a lockout period, a cushion, or a\ndeferment period.\n"}
