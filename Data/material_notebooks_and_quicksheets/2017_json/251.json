{"id": 251, "text": "The variance and standard deviation measure the dispersion, or volatility, of only one\nvariable. In many finance situations, however, we are interested in how two random\nvariables move in relation to each other. For investment applications, one of the most\nfrequently analyzed pairs of random variables is the returns of two assets. Investors and\nmanagers frequently ask questions such as, \"what is the relationship between the return\nfor Stock A and Stock B?\u201d or, \u201cwhat is the relationship between the performance of the\nS&P 500 and that of the automotive industry?\u201d\nCovariance is a measure of how two assets move together. It is the expected value of the\nproduct of the deviations of the two random variables from their respective expected\nvalues. A common symbol for the covariance between random variables X and Yis\nCov(X,Y). Since we will be mostly concerned with the covariance of asset returns, the\nfollowing formula has been written in terms of the covariance of the return of asset i, R:,\nand the return of assetj, R:\n"}
