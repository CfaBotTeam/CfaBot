{"id": "760", "text": "Unsolicited Trade Requests\nAn investment manager may receive a client request to purchase a security that the\nmanager knows is unsuitable, given the client's investment policy statement. The trade\nmay or may not have a material effect on the risk characteristics of the client's total\nportfolio and the requirements are different for each case. In either case, however, the\nmanager should not make the trade until he has discussed with the client the reasons\n(based on the IPS) that the trade is unsuitable for the client's account.\n"}
