There is a 60% probability the\neconomy will outperform, and if it does, there is a 70% chance a stock will go up\nand a 30% chance the stock will go down. There is a 40% chance the economy will\nunderperform, and if it does, there is a 20% chance the stock in question will increase\nin value (have gains) and an 80% chance it will not.
