{"id": 3201, "text": "Note that the convexity adjustment to the price change is the same for both an increase\nand a decrease in yield. As illustrated in Figure 5, the duration-only based estimate of\nthe increase in price resulting from a decrease in yield is too low for a bond with positive\nconvexity, and is improved by a positive adjustment for convexity. The duration-only\nbased estimate of the decrease in price resulting from an increase in yield is larger than\nthe actual decrease, so it's also improved by a positive adjustment for convexity.\n"}
