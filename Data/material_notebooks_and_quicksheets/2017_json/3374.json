{"id": 3374, "text": "In contrast to this model of calculating the current value of a risky asset, the valuation\nof derivative securities is based on a no-arbitrage condition. Arbitrage refers to a\ntransaction wherein an investor purchases one asset (or portfolio of assets) at one price\nand simultaneously sells an asset or portfolio that has the same future payoff, regardless\nof future events, at a higher price, realizing a risk-free gain on the transaction. While\narbitrage opportunities may be rare, the reasoning is that when they do exist they will\nbe exploited rapidly. Therefore, we can use the no-arbitrage condition to determine the\ncurrent value (spot price) of an asset or portfolio of assets that have the same future\npayoffs regardless of future events. Because there are transactions costs of exploiting an\narbitrage opportunity, small differences in price may persist because the arbitrage gain is\nless than the transactions cost of exploiting it.\n"}
