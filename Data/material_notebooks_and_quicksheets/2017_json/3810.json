{"id": 3810, "text": "Yield spreads are useful for analyzing the factors that affect a bond's yield. If a\ncorporate bond's yield increases from 6.25% to 6.50%, this may have been caused\nby factors that affect all bond yields (macroeconomic factors) or by firm-specific or\nindustry-specific (microeconomic) factors. If a bond's yield increases but its yield\nspread remains the same, the yield on its benchmark must have also increased, which\nsuggests macroeconomic factors caused bond yields in general to increase. However, if\nthe yield spread increases, this suggests the increase in the bond's yield was caused by\nmicroeconomic factors such as credit risk or the issue's liquidity.\n"}
