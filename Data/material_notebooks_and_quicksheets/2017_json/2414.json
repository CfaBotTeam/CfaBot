{"id": 2414, "text": "LOS 44.d\nWillingness to take financial risk is related to an investor's psychological factors, such as\npersonality type and level of financial knowledge.\nAbility or capacity to take risk depends on financial factors, such as wealth relative to\nliabilities, income stability, and time horizon.\nA client's overall risk tolerance depends on both his ability to take risk and his\nwillingness to take risk. A willingness greater than ability, or vice versa, is typically\nresolved by choosing the more conservative of the two and counseling the client.\n"}
