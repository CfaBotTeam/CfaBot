{"id": "1180", "text": "Export subsidies are payments by a government to its country's exporters. Export\nsubsidies benefit producers (exporters) of the good but increase prices and reduce\nconsumer surplus in the exporting country. In a small country, the price will increase\nby the amount of the subsidy to equal the world price plus the subsidy. In the case of a\nlarge exporter of the good, the world price decreases and some benefits from the subsidy\naccrue to foreign consumers, while foreign producers are negatively affected.\nMost of the effects of all four of these protectionist policies are the same. With respect to\nthe domestic (importing) country, import quotas, tariffs, and VERs all:\nReduce imports.\nIncrease price.\nDecrease consumer surplus.\nIncrease domestic quantity supplied.\nIncrease producer surplus.\nWith one exception, all will decrease national welfare. Quotas and tariffs in a large\ncountry could increase national welfare under a specific set of assumptions, primarily\nbecause for a country that imports a large amount of the good, setting a quota or tariff\ncould reduce the world price for the good.\n"}
