{"id": 2277, "text": "LOS 42.d\nA risk-averse investor is one that dislikes risk. Given two investments that have equal\nexpected returns, a risk-averse investor will choose the one with less risk. However, a\nrisk-averse investor will hold risky assets if he feels that the extra return he expects to\nearn is adequate compensation for the additional risk. Assets in the financial markets are\npriced according to the preferences of risk-averse investors.\n"}
