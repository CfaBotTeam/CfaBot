{"id": "428", "text": "15. C From the table F(1.96) = 0.9750; thus, the answer is 0.9750 - 0.5 = 0.4750. Knowing\nthat 95% lie between -1.96 and +1.96, and that 0 is the midpoint, we can say that\n95% = 47.5% lie between 0 and +1.96.\n16. C z = (100 \u2013 175) / 25 = -3, F(-3) = 1 - 0.9987 = 0.0013\n17. C 1-F(2), where F(2) equals 0.9772. Hence, 1- 0.9772 = 0.0228.\n18. C 1 - F(-1) = F(1) = 0.8413.
