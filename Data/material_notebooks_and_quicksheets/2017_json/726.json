{"id": 726, "text": "Most of the examples in this book have used one version of the z-table to find the area\nunder the normal curve. This table provides the cumulative probabilities (or the area\nunder the entire curve to left of the z-value).\nProbability Example\nAssume that the annual earnings per share (EPS) for a large sample of firms is normally\ndistributed with a mean of $5.00 and a standard deviation of $1.50. What is the\napproximate probability of an observed EPS value falling between $3.00 and $7.25?\nIf EPS = x = $7.25, then z = (x-1)/o = ($7.25 - $5.00)/$1.50 = +1.50\nIf EPS = x= $3.00, then z = (x-p)/o = ($3.00 - $5.00)/$1.50 = -1.33\nSolving Using The Cumulative Z-Table\nFor z-value of 1.50: Use the row headed 1.5 and the column headed 0 to find the value\n0.9332. This represents the area under the curve to the left of the critical value 1.50.\nFor z-value of -1.33: Use the row headed 1.3 and the column headed 3 to find the value\n0.9082. This represents the area under the curve to the left of the critical value +1.33.\nThe area to the left of -1.33 is 1 - 0.9082 = 0.0918.\nThe area between these critical values is 0.9332 \u2013 0.0918 = 0.8414, or 84.14%.\nHypothesis Testing - One-Tailed Test Example\nA sample of a stock's returns on 36 nonconsecutive days results in a mean return of 2.0\npercent. Assume the population standard deviation is 20.0 percent. Can we say with 95\npercent confidence that the mean return is greater than zero percent?\n"}
