{"id": "3682", "text": "In a shelf registration, a bond issue is registered with securities regulators in its aggregate\nvalue with a master prospectus. Bonds can then be issued over time when the issuer\nneeds to raise funds. Because individual offerings under a shelf registration require less\ndisclosure than a separate registration of a bond issue, only financially sound companies\nare granted this option. In some countries, bonds registered under a shelf registration\ncan be sold only to qualified investors.\n"}
