{"id": 2338, "text": "Note that a low-beta stock, such as represented by Point C, is not necessarily low-risk\nwhen total risk is considered. While its contribution to the risk of a well-diversified\nportfolio may be low, its risk when held by itself can be considered quite high. A\nfirm whose only activity is developing a new, but as yet unproven, drug may be quite\nspeculative with highly uncertain returns. It may also have quite low systematic risk if\nthe uncertainty about its future returns depends primarily on firm-specific factors.\nAll stocks and portfolios that plot along the line labeled B = 1 in Figure 9 have the same\nexpected return as the market portfolio and, thus, according to the CAPM, have the\nsame systematic risk as the market portfolio (i.e., they all have betas of one).\nAll points on the CML (except the tangency point) represent the risk-return\ncharacteristics of portfolios formed by either combining the market portfolio with the\nrisk-free asset or borrowing at the risk-free rate in order to invest more than 100% of\nthe portfolio's net value in the risky market portfolio (investing on margin). Point D\nin Figure 9 represents a portfolio that combines the market portfolio with the risk-free\nasset, while points above the point of tangency, such as Point E, represent portfolios\ncreated by borrowing at the risk-free rate to invest in the market portfolio. Portfolios\nthat do not lie on the CML are not efficient and therefore have risk that will not be\nrewarded with higher expected returns in equilibrium.\nAccording to the CAPM, all securities and portfolios, diversified or not, will plot on\nthe SML in equilibrium. In fact, all stocks and portfolios along the line labeled B = 1 in\nFigure 9, including the market portfolio, will plot at the same point on the SML. They\nwill plot at the point on the SML with beta equal to one and expected return equal to\nthe expected return on the market, regardless of their total risk.\n"}
