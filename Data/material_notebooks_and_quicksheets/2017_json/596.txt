{"id": 596, "text": "If you know that violations of applicable rules or laws are taking place, either by\ncoworkers or clients, CFA Institute strongly encourages members and candidates\nto report potential violations. One way to do so is to approach your supervisor or\ncompliance department to remedy the situation. If they will not or cannot, then you\nmust dissociate from the activity (e.g., not working with a trading group you know is\nnot allocating client trades properly according to the Standard on Fair Dealing, or not\nusing marketing materials that you know or should know are misleading or erroneous).\nIf this cannot be accomplished, you may, in an extreme case, have to resign from the\nfirm to be in compliance with this Standard.\n"}
