{"id": 2239, "text": "Covariance and Correlation of Returns for Two Securities\nCovariance measures the extent to which two variables move together over time. A\npositive covariance means that the variables (e.g., rates of return on two stocks) tend\nto move together. Negative covariance means that the two variables tend to move in\nopposite directions. A covariance of zero means there is no linear relationship between\nthe two variables. To put it another way, if the covariance of returns between two assets\nis zero, knowing the return for the next period on one of the assets tells you nothing\nabout the return of the other asset for the period.\n"}
