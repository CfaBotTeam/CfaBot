{"id": "1804", "text": "This ratio differs from the return on total equity in that it only measures the\naccounting profits available to, and the capital invested by, common stockholders,\ninstead of common and preferred stockholders. That is why preferred dividends are\ndeducted from net income in the numerator. Analysts should be concerned if this\nratio is too low.\n"}
