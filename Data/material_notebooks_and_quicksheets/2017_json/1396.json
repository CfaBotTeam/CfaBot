{"id": "1396", "text": "Compared to the quantity produced under perfect competition, the quantity produced\nby a monopolist reduces the sum of consumer and producer surplus by an amount\nrepresented by the triangle labeled deadweight loss (DWL) in Panel (a) of Figure 20.\nConsumer surplus is reduced not only by the decrease in quantity but also by the\nincrease in price relative to perfect competition. Monopoly is considered inefficient\nbecause the reduction in output compared to perfect competition reduces the sum\nof consumer and producer surplus. Because marginal benefit is greater than marginal\ncost, less than the efficient quantity of resources are allocated to the production of the\ngood. Price discrimination reduces this inefficiency by increasing output toward the\nquantity where marginal benefit equals marginal cost. Note that the deadweight loss is\nsmaller in Panel (b). The firm gains from those customers with inelastic demand while\nstill providing goods to customers with more elastic demand. This may even cause\nproduction to take place when it would not otherwise.\n"}
