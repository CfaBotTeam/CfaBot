{"id": 3236, "text": "Bonds with credit risk trade at higher yields than bonds thought to be free of credit risk.\nThe difference in yield between a credit-risky bond and a credit-risk-free bond of similar\nmaturity is called its yield spread. For example, if a 5-year corporate bond is trading at a\nspread of +250 basis points to Treasuries and the yield on 5-year Treasury notes is 4.0%,\nthe yield on the corporate bond is 4.0% + 2.5% = 6.5%.\n"}
