{"id": "2633", "text": "Just by chance, some variables will be related to abnormal returns over a given period,\nalthough in fact these relationships are unlikely to persist over time. Thus, analysts\nusing historical data can find patterns in security returns that appear to violate market\nefficiency but are unlikely to recur in the future. If the analyst uses a 5% significance\nlevel and examines the relationship between stock returns and 40 variables, two of the\nvariables are expected to show a statistically significant relationship with stock returns by\nrandom chance. Recall that the significance level of a hypothesis test is the probability\nthat the null hypothesis (efficiency here) will be rejected purely by chance, even when\nit is true. Investigating data until a statistically significant relation is found is referred\nto as data mining or data snooping. Note that 1,000 analysts, each testing different\nhypotheses on the same data set, could produce the same results as a single researcher\nwho performed 1,000 hypothesis tests.\n"}
