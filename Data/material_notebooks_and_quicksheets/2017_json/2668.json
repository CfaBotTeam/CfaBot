Shareholders pay for the put option\nbecause other things equal, putable shares are sold for higher prices than non-putable\nshares and raise more capital for the firm when they are issued.\nPreference shares (or preferred stock) have features of both common stock and debt.\nAs with common stock, preferred stock dividends are not a contractual obligation, the\nshares usually do not mature, and the shares can have put or call features. Like debt,\npreferred shares typically make fixed periodic payments to investors and do not usually\nhave voting rights.\nCumulative preference shares are usually promised fixed dividends, and any dividends\nthat are not paid must be made up before common shareholders can receive dividends.\nThe dividends of non-cumulative preference shares do not accumulate over time\nwhen they are not paid, but dividends for any period must be paid before common\nshareholders can receive dividends.\n"}
