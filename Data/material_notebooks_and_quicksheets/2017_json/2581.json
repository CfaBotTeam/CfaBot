{"id": 2581, "text": "Fixed income securities vary widely with respect to their coupon rates, ratings,\nmaturities, and embedded options such as convertibility to common stock.\nConsequently, a wide variety of fixed income indexes is available. Like equity indexes,\nfixed income indexes are created for various sectors, geographic regions, and levels of\ncountry economic development. They can also be constructed based on type of issuer or\ncollateral, coupon, maturity, default risk, or inflation protection. Broad market indexes,\nsector indexes, style indexes, and other specialized indexes are available.\nInvestors should be aware of several issues with the construction of fixed income indexes:\n\u2022 Large universe of securities. The fixed income security universe is much broader than\nthe universe of stocks. Fixed income securities are issued not just by firms, but also\nby governments and government agencies. Each of these entities may also issue\nvarious types of fixed income securities. Also, unlike stocks, bonds mature and must\nbe replaced in fixed income indexes. As a result, turnover is high in fixed income\nindexes.\nDealer markets and infrequent trading. Fixed income securities are primarily traded\nby dealers, so index providers must depend on dealers for recent prices. Because\nfixed income securities are typically illiquid, a lack of recent trades may require index\nproviders to estimate the value of index securities from recent prices of securities\nwith similar characteristics.\nThe large number of fixed income securities results in large differences in the number\nof index securities among fixed income indexes. Illiquidity, transactions costs, and high\nturnover of constituent securities make it both difficult and expensive for fixed income\nportfolio managers to replicate a fixed income index.\n"}
