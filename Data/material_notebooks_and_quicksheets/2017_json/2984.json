{"id": "2984", "text": "The weights in the calculation of WACC should be based on the firm's target capital\nstructure; that is, the proportions (based on market values) of debt, preferred stock,\nand equity that the firm expects to achieve over time. In the absence of any explicit\ninformation about a firm's target capital structure from the firm itself, an analyst may\nsimply use the firm's current capital structure (based on market values) as the best\nindication of its target capital structure. If there has been a noticeable trend in the firm's\ncapital structure, the analyst may want to incorporate this trend into his estimate of the\nfirm\u2019s target capital structure. For example, if a firm has been reducing its proportion of\ndebt financing each year for two or three years, the analyst may wish to use a weight on\ndebt that is lower than the firm's current weight on debt in constructing the firm's target\ncapital structure.\n"}
