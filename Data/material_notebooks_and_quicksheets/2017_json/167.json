{"id": "167", "text": "Dividing by standard deviation cubed standardizes the statistic and allows interpretation\nof the skewness measure. If relative skewness is equal to zero, the data is not skewed.\nPositive levels of relative skewness imply a positively skewed distribution, whereas\nnegative values of relative skewness imply a negatively skewed distribution. Values of SK\nin excess of 0.5 in absolute value indicate significant levels of skewness.\n"}
