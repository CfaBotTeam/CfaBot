{"id": "287", "text": "There are 8! = 40,320 total possible sequences that can be followed to assign the\nthree labels to the eight stocks. However, the order that each stock is assigned a label\ndoes not matter. For example, it does not matter which of the stocks labeled \u201clongterm\u201d is the first to be labeled. Thus, there are 4! ways to assign the long-term label.\nContinuing this reasoning to the other categories, there are 4! x 3! x 1! equivalent\nsequences for assigning the labels. To eliminate the counting of these redundant\nsequences, the total number of possible sequences (8!) must be divided by the number\nof redundant sequences (4! x 3! x 1!).\n"}
