{"id": 3003, "text": "Because a specific project is not represented by a publicly traded security, we typically\ncannot estimate a project's beta directly. One process that can be used is based on the\nequity beta of a publicly traded firm that is engaged in a business similar to, and with\nrisk similar to, the project under consideration. This is referred to as the pure-play\nmethod because we begin with the beta of a company or group of companies that are\npurely engaged in a business similar to that of the project and are therefore comparable\nto the project. Thus, using the beta of a conglomerate that is engaged in the same\nbusiness as the project would be inappropriate because its beta depends on its many\ndifferent lines of business.\n"}
