{"id": 339, "text": "The assignment of probabilities to the possible outcomes for discrete and continuous\nrandom variables provides us with discrete probability distributions and continuous\nprobability distributions. The difference between these types of distributions is most\napparent for the following properties:\nFor a discrete distribution, p(x) = 0 when x cannot occur, or p(x) > 0 if it can. Recall\nthat p(x) is read: \u201cthe probability that random variable X = x.\" For example, the\nprobability of it raining on 33 days in June is zero because this cannot occur, but the\nprobability of it raining 25 days in June has some positive value.\nFor a continuous distribution, p(x) = 0 even though x can occur. We can only consider\nP(x, <X< x2) where x, and x, are actual numbers. For example, the probability of\nreceiving two inches of rain in June is zero because two inches is a single point in an\ninfinite range of possible values. On the other hand, the probability of the amount\nof rain being between 1.99999999 and 2.00000001 inches has some positive value.\nIn the case of continuous distributions, P(x, <X< x) = P(x, <X<x,) because\np(x) = p(x)) = 0.\nIn finance, some discrete distributions are treated as though they are continuous because\nthe number of possible outcomes is very large. For example, the increase or decrease in\nthe price of a stock traded on an American exchange is recorded in dollars and cents.\nYet, the probability of a change of exactly $1.33 or $1.34 or any other specific change\n"}
