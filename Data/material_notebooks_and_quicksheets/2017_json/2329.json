{"id": "2329", "text": "In practice, we estimate asset betas by regressing returns on the asset on those of the\nmarket index. While regression is a Level II concept, for our purposes, you can think of\nit as a mathematical estimation procedure that fits a line to a data plot. In Figure 5, we\nrepresent the excess returns on Asset i as the dependent variable and the excess returns\non the market index as the independent variable. The least squares regression line is the\nline that minimizes the sum of the squared distances of the points plotted from the line\n(this is what is meant by the line of best fit). The slope of this line is our estimate of beta.\nIn Figure 6, the line is steeper than 45 degrees, the slope is greater than one, and the\nasset's estimated beta is greater than one. Our interpretation is that the returns on Asset i\nare more variable in response to systematic risk factors than is the overall market, which\nhas a beta of one.\n"}
