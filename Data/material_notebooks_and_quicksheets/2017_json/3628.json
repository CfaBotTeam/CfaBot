{"id": "3628", "text": "An alternative way to give bondholders an opportunity for additional returns when\nthe firm's common shares increase in value is to include warrants with straight bonds\nwhen they are issued. Warrants give their holders the right to buy the firm's common\nshares at a given price over a given period of time. As an example, warrants that give\ntheir holders the right to buy shares for $40 will provide profits if the common shares\nincrease in value above $40 prior to expiration of the warrants. For a young firm, issuing\ndebt can be difficult because the downside (probability of firm failure) is significant,\nand the upside is limited to the promised debt payments. Including warrants, which\nare sometimes referred to as a \u201csweetener,\u201d makes the debt more attractive to investors\nbecause it adds potential upside profits if the common shares increase in value.\n"}
