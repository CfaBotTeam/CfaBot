{"id": "2481", "text": "In a short sale, the short seller must pay all dividends or interest that the lender would\nhave received from the security that has been loaned to the short seller. These payments\nare called payments-in-lieu of dividends or interest. The short seller must also deposit\nthe proceeds of the short sale as collateral to guarantee the eventual repurchase of the\nsecurity. The broker then earns interest on these funds and may return a portion of this\ninterest to the short seller at a rate referred to as the short rebate rate. The short rebate\nrate is usually only provided to institutional investors and is typically 0.1% less than\novernight interest rates. If the security is difficult to borrow, the short rebate rate may be\nlower or negative. The difference between the interest earned on the proceeds from the\nshort sale and the short rebate paid is the return to the lender of the securities. A short\nsale may also require the short seller to deposit additional margin in the form of cash or\nshort-term riskless securities.\n"}
