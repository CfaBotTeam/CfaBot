{"id": "2003", "text": "Cash Flow From Operations\nA capitalized expenditure is usually reported in the cash flow statement as an outflow\nfrom investing activities. If immediately expensed, the expenditure is reported as an\noutflow from operating activities. Thus, capitalizing an expenditure will result in higher\noperating cash flow and lower investing cash flow compared to expensing. Assuming no\ndifferences in tax treatment, total cash flow will be the same. The classification of the\ncash flow is the only difference.\n"}
