{"id": 1491, "text": "4. Technology: In general, improvements in technology increase labor productivity\n(output per unit of labor) and thereby increase the real output that can be produced\nfrom a given amount of productive inputs, increasing LRAS.\nDecreases in labor quality, labor supply, the supply of natural resources, or the stock of\nphysical capital will all decrease LRAS (move the curve to the left). Technology does not\nreally retreat, but a law prohibiting the use of an improved technology could decrease\nLRAS.\n"}
