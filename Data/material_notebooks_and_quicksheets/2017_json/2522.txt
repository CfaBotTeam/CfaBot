{"id": 2522, "text": "In an electronic crossing network, the typical trader is an institution. Orders are batched\ntogether and crossed (matched) at fixed points in time during the day at the average of\nthe bid and ask quotes from the exchange where the stock primarily trades. This pricing\nrule is referred to as the derivative pricing rule because it is derived from the security's\nmain market. The price is not determined by orders in the crossing network.\n"}
