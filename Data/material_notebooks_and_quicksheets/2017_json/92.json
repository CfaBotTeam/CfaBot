{"id": "92", "text": "1. A. She is correct in all regards. Bank discount yields are not true yields because they\nare based on a percentage of face (maturity) value instead of on the original amount\ninvested. They are annualized without compounding since the actual discount from face\nvalue is simply multiplied by the number of periods in a \u201cyear.\u201d The \u201cyear\u201d used is 360\ndays, so that is a shortcoming as well.\nB. The holding period yield uses the increase in value divided by the amount invested\n(purchase price), so it solves the problem that the BDY is not a true yield.\nC. The money market yield is also a true yield (a percentage of the initial investment) but\ndoes not solve the other two problems since it does not involve compounding and is\nbased on a 360-day year.\nD. The effective annual yield solves all three shortcomings. It is based on the holding period\nyield (so it is a true yield), is a compound annual rate, and is based on a 365-day year.\n2. A. Both investors have held the same single stock for both periods, so the time-weighted\nreturns must be identical for both accounts.\nB. The performance of the stock (annual total return) was better in the first year than in the\nsecond. Since Burns increased his holdings for the second period by more than Adams,\nthe Burns account has a greater weight on the poorer returns in a money-weighted\nreturn calculation and will have a lower annual money-weighted rate of return over the\ntwo-year period than Adams.\n3.\nSetting the retirement date to t= 0 we have the following choices:\n"}
