These \u201cuncertainties\u201d may\nrelate to the going concern assumption (the assumption that the firm will continue to\noperate for the foreseeable future), the valuation or realization of asset values, or to\nlitigation. This type of disclosure may be a signal of serious problems and may call for\nclose examination by the analyst.\nInternal controls are the processes by which the company ensures that it presents\naccurate financial statements. Internal controls are the responsibility of management. For\npublicly traded firms in the United States, the auditor must express an opinion on the\nfirm's internal controls. The auditor can provide this opinion separately or as the fourth\nelement of the standard opinion.\n"}
