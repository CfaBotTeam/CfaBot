{"id": 356, "text": "Recall that the \"|\" symbol means given. Hence, the preceding statement is read as: the\nexpected value of X given that n = 5, and the probability of success = 67% is 3.35.\nWe should note that since the binomial distribution is a discrete distribution, the\nresult X = 3.35 is not possible. However, if we were to record the results of many\n5-day periods, the average number of up days (successes) would converge to 3.35.\n"}
