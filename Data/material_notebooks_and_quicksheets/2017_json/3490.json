{"id": "3490", "text": "In writing covered calls, the term covered means that owning the stock covers the\nobligation to deliver stock assumed in writing the call. Why would you write a covered\ncall? You feel the stock's price will not go up any time soon, and you want to increase\nyour income by collecting the call option premium. To add some insurance that the\nstock won't get called away, the call writer can write out-of-the-money calls. You should\nknow that this strategy for enhancing one's income is not without risk. The call writer is\ntrading the stock's upside potential for the call premium.\nFigure 3 illustrates the profit/loss of a covered call position at option expiration date.\nWhen the call was written, the stock's price was $50. The call's strike price was $55, and\nthe call premium was $4. The call is out-of-the-money. From Figure 3, we can observe\nthat at expiration:\n\u2022 If the stock closes below $50, the option will expire worthless, and the option\nwriter's loss is offset by the premium income of $4.\nBreakeven for the position is at $46 = $50 \u2013 $4. Breakeven price = S, - call premium.\nIf the stock closes between $50 and $55, the option will expire worthless. Because\nthis option was an out-of-the-money call, the option writer will get any stock\nappreciation above the original stock price and below the strike price. So the gain\n(premium plus stock appreciation) will be between $4 and $9.\nIf stock closes above $55, the strike price, the writer will get nothing more. The\nmaximum gain is $9 on the covered out-of-the-money call.\nThe maximum loss occurs if the stock price goes to zero; the net cost of the position\n($46 = $50 stock loss offset by $4 premium income) is the maximum loss.\n"}
