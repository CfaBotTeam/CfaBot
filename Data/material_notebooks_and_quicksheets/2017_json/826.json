{"id": "826", "text": "16. A Standard V(B) Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients requires that\nmembers and candidates communicate the risk associated with the investment strategy\nused and how the strategy is expected to perform in a range of scenarios. These scenarios\nshould include those different from the current trend. Marlin should have discussed how\nher strategy would perform if the euro depreciates instead of appreciating as she expects.\n17. B When no other regulatory guidance applies, Standard V(C) Record Retention\nrecommends that records be maintained for a minimum of seven years.\n18. C Even though the shares are held in trust, Lyons is considered a beneficial owner under\nStandard VI(A) Disclosure of Conflicts because he has a pecuniary interest in the shares\nand because has the power to vote the shares. Lyons is obligated to inform his employer\nof the potential conflict. If Lyons's employer permits him to continue issuing investment\nrecommendations on the company, Lyons must disclose the existence of a potential\nconflict in his reports.\n19. C Only one of these transactions is a violation. Standard VI(B) Priority of Transactions\nrequires members and candidates to give clients an adequate opportunity to act on\na recommendation before trading for accounts in which the member or candidate\nhas a beneficial ownership interest. Members and candidates may trade for their own\naccounts as long as they do not disadvantage clients, benefit personally from client\ntrades, or violate any regulations that apply. The Standard does not prohibit members\nand candidates from entering personal transactions that are contrary to what their firms\nare recommending for clients, as long as the transaction does not violate any of these\ncriteria.\n"}
