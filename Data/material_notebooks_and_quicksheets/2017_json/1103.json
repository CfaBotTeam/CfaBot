{"id": "1103", "text": "Balanced Budget Multiplier\nIn order to balance the budget, the government could increase taxes by $100 to just\noffset a $100 increase in spending. Changes in taxes also have a magnified effect\non aggregate demand. An increase in taxes will decrease disposable income and\nconsumption expenditures, thereby decreasing aggregate demand. The initial decrease\nin spending from a tax increase of $100 is 100 x MPC = 100 x 0.8 = $80; beyond that,\nthe multiplier effect is the same as we described for a direct increase in government\nspending, and the overall decrease in aggregate demand for a $100 tax increase is\n100(MPC) x fiscal multiplier, or, for our example, 100(0.8)(2.5) = $200.\n"}
