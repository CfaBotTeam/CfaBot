The leveraged return is calculated as the gain or loss on the investment\nas a percentage of an investor's cash investment. An investment in a derivative security,\nsuch as a futures contract, produces a leveraged return because the cash deposited is\nonly a fraction of the value of the assets underlying the futures contract. Leveraged\ninvestments in real estate are very common: investors pay for only part of the cost of\nthe property with their own cash, and the rest of the amount is paid for with borrowed\nmoney.\n"}
