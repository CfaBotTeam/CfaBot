{"id": "2059", "text": "Analysis of Impairments\nAn impairment loss is an indication that the firm has not recognized sufficient\ndepreciation or amortization expense, and has overstated earnings as a result.\nThe judgment required in determining asset impairments gives management\nconsiderable discretion about the timing and amounts of impairment charges.\nConsequently, impairment decisions present an opportunity for management to\nmanipulate earnings. Waiting to recognize an impairment loss until a period of relatively\nhigh earnings would tend to smooth earnings.\n"}
