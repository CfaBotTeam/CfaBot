{"id": "2825", "text": "Because the dividend discount model is very sensitive to its inputs, many investors rely\non other methods. In a price multiple approach, an analyst compares a stock's price\nmultiple to a benchmark value based on an index, industry group of firms, or a peer\ngroup of firms within an industry. Common price multiples used for valuation include\nprice-to-earnings, price-to-cash flow, price-to-sales, and price-to-book value ratios.\nPrice multiples are widely used by analysts and readily available in numerous media\noutlets. Price multiples are easily calculated and can be used in time series and crosssectional comparisons. Many of these ratios have been shown to be useful for predicting\nstock returns, with low multiples associated with higher future returns.\n"}
