{"id": "1058", "text": "A second cost of unexpected inflation is that information about supply and demand\nfrom changes in prices becomes less reliable. Suppose that when expected inflation\nis 5%, a manufacturer sees that prices for his product have increased 10%. If this is\ninterpreted as an increase in demand for the product, the manufacturer will increase\ncapacity and production in response to the perceived increase in demand. If, in fact,\ngeneral price inflation is 10% rather than the expected 5% over the recent period, the\nprice increase in the manufacturer's product did not result from an increase in demand.\nThe expansion of production will result in excess inventory and capacity, and the firm\nwill decrease production, laying off workers and reducing or eliminating expenditures\non increased capacity for some time. Because of these effects, unexpected inflation\ncan increase the magnitude or frequency of business cycles. The destabilizing effects\nof inflation, either higher than expected or lower than expected, because of reduced\ninformation content of price changes impose real costs on an economy.\n"}
