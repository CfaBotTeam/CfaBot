{"id": 1262, "text": "this reason, the compositions of export goods and import goods are an important\ndeterminant of the success of currency depreciation in reducing a trade deficit. In\ngeneral, elasticity of demand is greater for goods with close substitutes, goods that\nrepresent a high proportion of consumer spending, and luxury goods in general. Goods\nthat are necessities, have few or no good substitutes, or represent a small proportion of\noverall expenditures tend to have less elastic demand. Thus, currency depreciation will\nhave a greater effect on the balance of trade when import or export goods are primarily\nluxury goods, goods with close substitutes, and goods that represent a large proportion\nof overall spending.\n"}
