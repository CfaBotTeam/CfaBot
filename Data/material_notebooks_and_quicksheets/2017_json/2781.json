The more confident the investor is about the estimated inputs used in the valuation\nmodel, the more likely the investor is to take an investment position in a stock that\nis identified as overvalued or undervalued. Analysts must also consider the sensitivity\nof a model value to each of its inputs in deciding whether to act on a difference\nbetween model values and market prices. If a decrease of one-half percent in the\nlong-term growth rate used in the valuation model would produce an estimated\nvalue equal to the market price, an analyst would have to be quite sure of the\nmodel's growth estimate to take a position in the stock based on its estimated value.\n"}
