{"id": "1113", "text": "Fiscal policy is implemented through changes in taxes and spending. This is called\ndiscretionary fiscal policy (as opposed to automatic stabilizers discussed previously).\nDiscretionary fiscal policy would be designed to be expansionary when the economy\nis operating below full employment. Fiscal policy aims to stabilize aggregate demand.\nDuring recessions, actions can be taken to increase government spending or decrease\ntaxes. Either change tends to strengthen the economy by increasing aggregate demand,\nputting more money in the hands of corporations and consumers to invest and spend.\nDuring inflationary economic booms, actions can be taken to decrease government\nspending or increase taxes. Either change tends to slow the economy by decreasing\naggregate demand, taking money out of the hands of corporations and consumers,\ncausing both investment and consumption spending to fall.\n"}
