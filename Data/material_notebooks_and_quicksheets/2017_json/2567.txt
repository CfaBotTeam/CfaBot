{"id": 2567, "text": "An advantage of a fundamental-weighted index is that it avoids the bias of market\ncapitalization-weighted indexes toward the performance of the shares of overvalued firms\nand away from the performance of the shares of undervalued firms. A fundamentalweighted index will actually have a value tilt, overweighting firms with high value-based\nmetrics such as book-to-market ratios or earnings yields. Note that a firm with a high\nearnings yield (total earnings to total market value) relative to other index firms will by\nconstruction have a higher weight in an earnings-weighted index because, among index\nstocks, its earnings are high relative to its market value.\n"}
