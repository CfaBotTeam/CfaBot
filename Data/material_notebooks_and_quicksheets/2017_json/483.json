{"id": 483, "text": "There are two limitations on this idea of \u201clarger is better\u201d when it comes to selecting\nan appropriate sample size. One is that larger samples may contain observations from\na different population (distribution). If we include observations which come from a\ndifferent population (one with a different population parameter), we will not necessarily\nimprove, and may even reduce, the precision of our population parameter estimates. The\nother consideration is cost. The costs of using a larger sample must be weighed against\nthe value of the increase in precision from the increase in sample size. Both of these\nfactors suggest that the largest possible sample size is not always the most appropriate\nchoice.\n"}
