{"id": 941, "text": "Loan Payments and Amortization\nLoan amortization is the process of paying off a loan with a series of periodic loan\npayments, whereby a portion of the outstanding loan amount is paid off, or amortized,\nwith each payment. When a company or individual enters into a long-term loan, the\ndebt is usually paid off over time with a series of equal, periodic loan payments, and\neach payment includes the repayment of principal and an interest charge. The payments\nmay be made monthly, quarterly, or even annually. Regardless of the payment frequency,\nthe size of the payment remains fixed over the life of the loan. The amount of the\nprincipal and interest component of the loan payment, however, does not remain fixed\nover the term of the loan. Let's look at some examples to more fully develop the concept\nof amortization.\n"}
