In a\ndowntrend, the trendline connects the decreasing highs in price. When the price crosses\nthe trendline by what the analyst considers a significant amount, a breakout from a\ndowntrend or a breakdown from an uptrend is said to occur. Either a breakout or a\nbreakdown may signal the end of the previous trend.\n"}
