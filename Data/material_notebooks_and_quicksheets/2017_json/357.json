{"id": "357", "text": "A binomial model can be applied to stock price movements. We just need to define\nthe two possible outcomes and the probability that each outcome will occur. Consider\na stock with current price S that will, over the next period, either increase in value or\ndecrease in value (the only two possible outcomes). The probability of an up-move\n(the up transition probability, u) is p and the probability of a down-move (the down\ntransition probability, d) is (1 - p). For our example, the up-move factor (U) is 1.01\nand the down-move factor (D) is 1/1.01. The probability that the stock price will move\nto S(1.01) over the next period is p and the probability that the stock price will move to\nS/1.01 is 1- p.\n"}
