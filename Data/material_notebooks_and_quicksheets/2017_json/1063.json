{"id": "1063", "text": "When an increase in the price of a related good decreases demand for a good, the two\ngoods are complements. If an increase in the price of automobiles (less automobiles\npurchased) leads to a decrease in the demand for gasoline, they are complements. Right\nshoes and left shoes are perfect complements for most of us and, as a result, shoes are\npriced by the pair. If they were priced separately, there is little doubt that an increase in\nthe price of left shoes would decrease the quantity demanded of right shoes. Overall, the\ncross price elasticity of demand is more positive the better substitutes two goods are and\nmore negative the better complements the two goods are.\n"}
