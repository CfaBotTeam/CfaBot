{"id": 3845, "text": "Securitization refers to a process by which financial assets (e.g., mortgages, accounts\nreceivable, or automobile loans) are purchased by an entity that then issues securities\nsupported by the cash flows from those financial assets. The primary benefits of the\nsecuritization of financial assets are (1) a reduction in funding costs for firms selling\nthe financial assets to the securitizing entity and (2) an increase in the liquidity of the\nunderlying financial assets.\nConsider a bank that makes mortgage loans to home buyers and retains and\nservices these loans (i.e., collects the mortgage payments and performs the necessary\nrecordkeeping functions). To gain exposure to a bank's mortgage loans, investors\ntraditionally could only choose among investing in bank deposits, bank debt securities,\nor the common equity of banks.\nCompared to this traditional structure, with the bank serving the function of financial\nintermediary between borrowers and lenders, securitization can provide the following\nbenefits:\nSecuritization reduces intermediation costs, which results in lower funding costs for\nborrowers and higher risk-adjusted returns for lenders (investors).\nWith securitization, the investors\u2019 legal claim to the mortgages or other loans is\nstronger than it is with only a general claim against the bank's overall assets.\nWhen a bank securitizes its loans, the securities are actively traded, which increases\nthe liquidity of the bank's assets compared to holding the loans.\nBy securitizing loans, banks are able to lend more than if they could only fund\nloans with bank assets. When a loan portfolio is securitized, the bank receives the\nproceeds, which can then be used to make more loans.\n"}
