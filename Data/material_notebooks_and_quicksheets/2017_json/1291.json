{"id": "1291", "text": "In Figure 4, we illustrate all three cases. For quantities of labor between zero and A,\nthe marginal product of labor is increasing (slope is increasing). Beyond the inflection\npoint in the production at quantity of labor A up to quantity B, the marginal product of\nlabor is still positive but decreasing. The slope of the production function is positive but\ndecreasing, and we are in a range of diminishing marginal productivity of labor. Beyond\nthe quantity of labor B, adding additional workers decreases total output. The marginal\nproduct of labor in this range is negative, and the production function slopes downward.\n"}
