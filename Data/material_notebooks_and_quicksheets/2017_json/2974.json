You only have two choices, 15% and 20%. Pick one and solve the NPV; if it's\nnot close to zero, you guessed wrong-pick the other one. Alternatively, you can solve\ndirectly for the IRR as CF, =-5,000, CF, = 3,000, CF, = 2,000, CF3 = 2,000.\nIRR = 20.64%.\n10. B PI = PV of future cash flows / CF, (discounted cash flows years 0 to 3 calculated in\nQuestion 7). PI = (2,727 + 1,653 + 1,503) 75,000 = 1.177.\n11.
