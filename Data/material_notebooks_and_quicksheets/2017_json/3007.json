{"id": 3007, "text": "While the method is theoretically correct, there are several challenging issues involved in\nestimating the beta of the comparable (or any) company's equity:\nBeta is estimated using historical returns data. The estimate is sensitive to the length\nof time used and the frequency (daily, weekly, etc.) of the data.\nThe estimate is affected by which index is chosen to represent the market return.\nBetas are believed to revert toward 1 over time, and the estimate may need to be\nadjusted for this tendency.\n\u2022 Estimates of beta for small-capitalization firms may need to be adjusted upward\nto reflect risk inherent in small firms that is not captured by the usual estimation\nmethods.\n"}
