{"id": 3502, "text": "A contingency provision in a contract describes an action that may be taken if an\nevent (the contingency) actually occurs. Contingency provisions in bond indentures\nare referred to as embedded options, embedded in the sense that they are an integral\npart of the bond contract and are not a separate security. Some embedded options are\nexercisable at the option of the issuer of the bond and, therefore, are valuable to the\nissuer; others are exercisable at the option of the purchaser of the bond and, thus, have\nvalue to the bondholder.\n"}
