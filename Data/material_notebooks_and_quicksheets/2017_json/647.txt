{"id": 647, "text": "5. B The alternative hypothesis, H: p > $145,000, only allows for values greater than the\nhypothesized value. Thus, this is a one-sided (one-tailed) test.\n6. B For a one-tailed z-test at the 1% level of significance, the critical z-value is z0.01 = 2.33.\nSince the test is one-tailed on the upper end (i.e., H: p > 145,000), we use a positive\nz-critical value.\n7. B The decision rule is to reject H, if z-computed > z-critical. Since 1.1875 < 2.33, Roberts\nwill fail to reject the null.\n8. A Ho: p = 3 hours\n9. B This is a two-sided (two-tailed) test.
