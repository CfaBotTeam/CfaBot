{"id": 2687, "text": "management makes decisions that increase income and retained earnings, they increase\nthe book value of equity.\nThe market value of equity is the total value of a firm's outstanding equity shares\nbased on market prices and reflects the expectations of investors about the firm's future\nperformance. Investors use their perceptions of the firm's risk and the amounts and\ntiming of future cash flows to determine the market value of equity. The market value\nand book value of equity are seldom equal. Although management may be maximizing\nthe book value of equity, this may not be reflected in the market value of equity because\nbook value does not reflect investor expectations about future firm performance.\n"}
