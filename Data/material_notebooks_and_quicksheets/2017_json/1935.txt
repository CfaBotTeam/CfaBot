{"id": 1935, "text": "A writedown of inventory to net realizable value affects the financial statements and\nratios in several ways. Assuming the writedown is reported as part of the cost of sales,\nthese effects in the period of the writedown include:\nAs inventory is part of current assets, an inventory writedown decreases both current\nand total assets.\nCurrent ratio (CA/CL) decreases. However, the quick ratio is unaffected because\ninventories are not included in the numerator of the quick ratio.\nInventory turnover (COGS/average inventory) is increased, which decreases days\ninventory on hand and the cash conversion cycle.\nThe decrease in total assets increases total asset turnover and increases the debt-toassets ratio.\nEquity is decreased, increasing the debt-to-equity ratio.\nThe increase in COGS reduces gross margin, operating margin, and net margin.\nThe percentage decrease in net income can be expected to be greater than the\npercentage decrease assets or equity. As a result, both ROA and ROE are decreased.\nFor periods subsequent to a writedown of inventory to net realizable value, COGS\nmay be decreased by lower inventory carrying values, which will increase profitability.\nTogether with the decreases in assets and equity from the prior-period writedown, an\nincrease in net income from decreased COGS will increase reported ROA and ROE in\nsubsequent periods.\n"}
