{"id": 3822, "text": "Current yield is the ratio of a bond's annual coupon payments to its price. Simple yield\nadjusts current yield by using straight-line amortization of any discount or premium.\nFor a callable bond, a yield-to-call may be calculated using each of its call dates and\nprices. The lowest of these yields and YTM is a callable bond's yield-to-worst.\nFloating rate notes have a quoted margin relative to a reference rate, typically Libor. The\nquoted margin is positive for issuers with more credit risk than the banks that quote\nLibor and may be negative for issuers that have less credit risk than loans to these banks.\nThe required margin on a floating rate note may be greater than the quoted margin\nif credit quality has decreased, or less than the quoted margin if credit quality has\nincreased.\n"}
