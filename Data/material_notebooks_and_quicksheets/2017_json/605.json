{"id": "605", "text": "To illustrate the chi-square distribution, consider a two-tailed test with a 5% level of\nsignificance and 30 degrees of freedom. As displayed in Figure 7, the critical chi-square\nvalues are 16.791 and 46.979 for the lower and upper bounds, respectively. These values\nare obtained from a chi-square table, which is used in the same manner as a t-table. A\nportion of a chi-square table is presented in Figure 8.\n"}
