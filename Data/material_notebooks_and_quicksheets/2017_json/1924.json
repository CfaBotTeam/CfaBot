{"id": "1924", "text": "Under U.S. GAAP, inventory is reported on the balance sheet at the lower of cost or\nmarket. Market is usually equal to replacement cost, but cannot be greater than net\nrealizable value (NRV) or less than NRV minus a normal profit margin. If replacement\ncost exceeds NRV, then market is NRV. If replacement cost is less than NRV minus a\nnormal profit margin, then market is NRV minus a normal profit margin.\n"}
