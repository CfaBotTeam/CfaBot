{"id": "3148", "text": "BOND Prices, YIELDS, AND RATINGS\nThere are two important points about fixed-income securities that we will develop\nfurther along in the Fixed Income study sessions but may be helpful as you read this\ntopic review.\nThe most common type of fixed-income security is a bond that promises to make\na series of interest payments in fixed amounts and to repay the principal amount\nat maturity. When market interest rates (i.e., yields on bonds) increase, the value\nof such bonds decreases because the present value of a bond's promised cash flows\ndecreases when a higher discount rate is used.\nBonds are rated based on their relative probability of default (failure to make\npromised payments). Because investors prefer bonds with lower probability of\ndefault, bonds with lower credit quality must offer investors higher yields to\ncompensate for the greater probability of default. Other things equal, a decrease in\na bond's rating (an increased probability of default) will decrease the price of the\nbond, thus increasing its yield.\nLOS 51.a: Describe basic features of a fixed-income security.\n"}
