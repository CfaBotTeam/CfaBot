{"id": "2947", "text": "Project X has a higher IRR, but Project Y has a higher NPV. Which is the better\nproject? If Project X is selected, the firm will be worth \u20ac895 more because the PV of\nthe expected cash flows is \u20ac895 more than the initial cost of the project. Project Y,\nhowever, is expected to increase the value of the firm by \u20ac1,484. Project Y is the better\nproject. Because NPV measures the expected increase in wealth from undertaking a\nproject, NPV is the only acceptable criterion when ranking projects.\nAnother reason, besides cash flow timing differences, that NPV and IRR may give\nconflicting project rankings is differences in project size. Consider two projects, one\nwith an initial outlay of $100,000, and one with an initial outlay of $1 million. The\nsmaller project may have a higher IRR, but the increase in firm value (NPV) may be\nsmall compared to the increase in firm value (NPV) of the larger project, even though\nits IRR is lower.\n"}
