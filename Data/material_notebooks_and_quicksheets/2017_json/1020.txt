{"id": 1020, "text": "10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\nAt point (a), in a higher price range, the price elasticity of demand is greater than at\npoint (c) in a lower price range.\nThe elasticity at point (b) is -1.0; a 1% increase in price leads to a 1% decrease in\nquantity demanded. This is the point of greatest total revenue (P x Q), which is 4.50\nx 45 = $202.50.\nAt prices less than $4.50 (inelastic range), total revenue will increase when price\nincreases. The percentage decrease in quantity demanded will be less than the\npercentage increase in price.\nAt prices above $4.50 (elastic range), a price increase will decrease total revenue\nsince the percentage decrease in quantity demanded will be greater than the\npercentage increase in price.\nAn important point to consider about the price and quantity combination for which\nprice elasticity equals -1.0 (unit or unitary elasticity) is that total revenue (price x\nquantity) is maximized at that price. An increase in price moves us to the elastic region\nof the curve so that the percentage decrease in quantity demanded is greater than the\npercentage increase in price, resulting in a decrease in total revenue. A decrease in price\nfrom the point of unitary elasticity moves us into the inelastic region of the curve so\nthat the percentage decrease in price is more than the percentage increase in quantity\ndemanded, resulting, again, in a decrease in total revenue.\n"}
