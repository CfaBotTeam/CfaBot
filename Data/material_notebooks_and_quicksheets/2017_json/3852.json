{"id": 3852, "text": "Securitizations may involve a single class of ABS so the cash flows to the securities are\nthe same for all security holders. They can also be structured with multiple classes of\nsecurities, each with a different claim to the cash flows of the underlying assets. The\ndifferent classes are often referred to as tranches. With this structure, a particular risk of\nthe ABS securities is redistributed across the tranches. Some bear more of the risk and\nothers bear less of the risk. The total risk is unchanged, simply reapportioned.\n"}
