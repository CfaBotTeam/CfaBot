{"id": 2077, "text": "LOS 38.a\nCash dividends are a payment from a company to a shareholder that reduces both the\nvalue of the company's assets and the market value of equity. They can come in the\nforms of regular, special, or liquidating dividends.\nStock dividends are distributions of new shares rather than cash. Stock splits divide each\nexisting share into multiple shares. Both create more shares, but there is a proportionate\ndrop in the price per share, so there is no effect on the total value of each shareholder's\nshares.\n"}
