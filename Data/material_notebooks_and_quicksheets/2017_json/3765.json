{"id": "3765", "text": "For the annual YTM on the quarterly-pay bond, we need to calculate the effective\nquarterly yield and multiply by four. The quarterly yield (yield per quarter) that is\nequivalent to a yield of 2% per six months is 1.02% - 1 = 0.995%. The quoted annual\nrate for the equivalent yield on a quarterly bond basis is 4 x 0.995 = 3.98%.\nNote that we have shown that the effective annual yields are the same for:\n\u2022 An annual coupon bond with a yield of 4.04% on an annual basis (periodicity of\none).\nA semiannual coupon bond with a yield of 4.0% on a semiannual basis\n(periodicity of two).\nA quarterly coupon bond with a yield of 3.98% on quarterly basis (periodicity of\nfour).\n"}
