{"id": 2483, "text": "At the time of a new margin purchase, investors are required to provide a minimum\namount of equity, referred to as the initial margin requirement. This requirement may\nbe set by the government, exchange, clearinghouse, or broker. Lower risk in an investor's\nportfolio will often result in the broker lending more funds.\nThe use of leverage magnifies both the gains and losses from changes in the value of the\nunderlying asset. The additional risk from the use of borrowed funds is referred to as risk\nfrom financial leverage.\n"}
