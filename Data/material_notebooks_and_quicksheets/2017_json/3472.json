{"id": 3472, "text": "Step-up coupon bonds are structured so that the coupon rate increases over time\naccording to a predetermined schedule. Typically, step-up coupon bonds have a call\nfeature that allows the firm to redeem the bond issue at a set price at each step-up date.\nIf the new higher coupon rate is greater than what the market yield would be at the call\nprice, the firm will call the bonds and retire them. This means if market yields rise, a\nbondholder may, in turn, get a higher coupon rate because the bonds are less likely to be\ncalled on the step-up date.\n"}
