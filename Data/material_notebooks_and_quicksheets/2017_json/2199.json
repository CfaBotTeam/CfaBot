{"id": 2199, "text": "Modifying Risk Exposures\nRisk management does not seek to eliminate all risks. The goal is to retain the optimal\nmix of risks for the organization. This may mean taking on more of some risks,\ndecreasing others, and eliminating some altogether. Once the risk management team has\nestimated various risks, management may decide to prevent or avoid a risk, accept a risk,\ntransfer a risk, or shift a risk.\n"}
