{"id": "3889", "text": "Reducing the prepayment risk of the PAC tranches is achieved by increasing the\nprepayment risk of the CMO's support tranches. If principal repayments are more rapid\nthan expected, the support tranche receives the principal repayments in excess of those\nspecifically allocated to the PAC tranches. Conversely, if the actual principal repayments\nare slower than expected, principal repayments to the support tranche are curtailed so\nthe scheduled PAC payments can be made. The larger the support tranche(s) relative to\nthe PAC tranches, the smaller the probability that the cash flows to the PAC tranches\nwill differ from their scheduled payments.\n"}
