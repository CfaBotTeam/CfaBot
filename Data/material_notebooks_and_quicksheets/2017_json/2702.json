{"id": "2702", "text": "LOS 48.6\nSome companies' equity shares are divided into different classes, such as Class A and\nClass B shares. Different classes of common equity may have different voting rights and\npriority in liquidation.\nLOS 48.\nCompared to publicly traded firms, private equity firms have lower reporting costs,\ngreater ability to focus on long-term prospects, and potentially greater return for\ninvestors once the firm goes public. However, private equity investments are illiquid,\nfirm financial disclosure may be limited, and corporate governance may be weaker.\nLOS 48.d\nInvestors who buy foreign stock directly on a foreign stock exchange receive a return\ndenominated in a foreign currency, must abide by the foreign stock exchange's\nregulations and procedures, and may be faced with less liquidity and less transparency\nthan is available in the investor's domestic markets. Investors can often avoid these\ndisadvantages by purchasing depository receipts for the foreign stock that trade on their\ndomestic exchange.\n"}
