{"id": "2037", "text": "There is no fair value alternative for asset reporting under U.S. GAAP. Under IFRS,\nmost long-lived assets are also reported at depreciated cost (the cost model). IFRS\nprovides an alternative, the revaluation model, that permits a long-lived asset to be\nreported at its fair value, as long as an active market exists for the asset so its fair value\ncan be reliably (and somewhat objectively) estimated. Firms must choose the same\ntreatment for similar assets (e.g., land and buildings) so they cannot revalue only specific\nassets that are more likely to increase than decrease in value. The revaluation model is\nrarely used in practice by IFRS reporting firms.\n"}
