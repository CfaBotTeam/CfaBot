{"id": "872", "text": "It is often a good idea to draw a time line before you start to solve a TVM problem. A\ntime line is simply a diagram of the cash flows associated with a TVM problem. A cash\nflow that occurs in the present (today) is put at time zero. Cash outflows (payments) are\ngiven a negative sign, and cash inflows (receipts) are given a positive sign. Once the cash\nfows are assigned to a time line, they may be moved to the beginning of the investment\nperiod to calculate the PV through a process called discounting or to the end of the\nperiod to calculate the FV using a process called compounding.\n"}
