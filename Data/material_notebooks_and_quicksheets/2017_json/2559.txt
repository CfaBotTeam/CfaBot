{"id": 2559, "text": "A price-weighted index is simply an arithmetic average of the prices of the securities\nincluded in the index. The divisor of a price-weighted index is adjusted for stock splits\nand changes in the composition of the index when securities are added or deleted, such\nthat the index value is unaffected by such changes.\nThe advantage of a price-weighted index is that its computation is simple. One\ndisadvantage is that a given percentage change in the price of a higher priced stock has\na greater impact on the index's value than does an equal percentage change in the price\nof a lower priced stock. Put another way, higher priced stocks have more weight in the\ncalculation of a price-weighted index. Additionally, a stock's weight in the index going\nforward changes if the firm splits its stock, repurchases stock, or issues stock dividends,\nas all of these actions will affect the price of the stock and therefore its weight in the\nindex.
