{"id": "1811", "text": "The DuPont system of analysis is an approach that can be used to analyze return on\nequity (ROE). It uses basic algebra to break down ROE into a function of different\nratios, so an analyst can see the impact of leverage, profit margins, and turnover on\nshareholder returns. There are two variants of the DuPont system: The original\nthree-part approach and the extended five-part system.\nFor the original approach, start with ROE defined as:\nnet income\nreturn on equity =\n| average equity)\n"}
