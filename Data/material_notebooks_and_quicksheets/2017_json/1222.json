{"id": "1222", "text": "In a foreign currency quotation we have the price of one currency in units of another\ncurrency. These are often referred to as the base currency and the price currency. In\nthe quotation 1.25 USD/EUR, the USD is the price currency and the EUR is the base\ncurrency. The price of one euro (base currency) is 1.25 USD (the price currency) so\n1.25 is the price of one unit of the base currency in terms of the other. It may help to\nremember that the euro in this example is in the bottom or \u201cbase\u201d of the exchange rate\ngiven in terms of USD/EUR.\n"}
