{"id": 919, "text": "Present Value of a Perpetuity\nA perpetuity is a financial instrument that pays a fixed amount of money at set intervals\nover an infinite period of time. In essence, a perpetuity is a perpetual annuity. British\nconsol bonds and most preferred stocks are examples of perpetuities since they promise\nfixed interest or dividend payments forever. Without going into all the excruciating\nmathematical details, the discount factor for a perpetuity is just one divided by the\nappropriate rate of return (i.e., 1/r). Given this, we can compute the PV of a perpetuity.\nPMT\n"}
