{"id": 805, "text": "Recommendations for Firms\nAll firms should have basic procedures in place that address conflicts created by personal\ninvesting. The following areas should be included:\nEstablish limitations on employee participation in equity IPOS.\nEstablish restrictions on participation in private placements. Strict limits should be\nplaced on employee acquisition of these securities and proper supervisory procedures\nshould be in place. Participation in these investments raises conflict of interest issues\nsimilar to those of IPOS.\nEstablish blackout/restricted periods. Employees involved in investment decision\nmaking should have blackout periods prior to trading for clients\u2014no front running\n(i.e., purchase or sale of securities in advance of anticipated client or employer\npurchases and sales). The size of the firm and the type of security should help dictate\nhow severe the blackout requirement should be.\nEstablish reporting procedures, including duplicate trade confirmations, disclosure\nof personal holdings and beneficial ownership positions, and preclearance\nprocedures.\n"}
