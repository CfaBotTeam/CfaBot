{"id": 1163, "text": "A country is said to have an absolute advantage in the production of a good if it can\nproduce the good at lower cost in terms of resources than that of another country.\nA country is said to have a comparative advantage in the production of a good if its\nopportunity cost in terms of other goods that could be produced instead is lower than\nthat of another country. Economic analysis tells us that regardless of which country has\nan absolute advantage, there are potential gains from trade as long as the opportunity\ncosts of one good in terms of another are different.\nThis analysis was first published by David Ricardo in 1817. He used the example of the\nproduction of cloth and wine in England and Portugal. The costs of labor to produce\none unit of cloth and one unit of wine for both countries were given as shown in Figure 1.\n"}
