{"id": 3392, "text": "Consider an FRA that will, in 30 days, pay the difference between 90-day Libor and the\n90-day rate specified in the FRA (the contract rate). A company that expects to borrow\n90-day funds in 30 days will have higher interest costs if 90-day Libor 30 days from now\nincreases. A long position in the FRA (pay fixed, receive floating) will receive a payment\nthat will offset the increase in borrowing costs from the increase in 90-day Libor.\nConversely, if 90-day Libor 30 days from now decreases over the next 30 days, the long\nposition in the FRA will make a payment to the short in the amount that the company's\nborrowing costs have decreased relative to the FRA contract rate.\n"}
