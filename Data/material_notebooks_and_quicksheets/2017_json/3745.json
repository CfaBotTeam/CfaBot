{"id": 3745, "text": "Example: Calculating the full price of a bond\nA 5% bond makes coupon payments on June 15 and December 15 and is trading with\na YTM of 4%. The bond is purchased and will settle on August 21 when there will\nbe four coupons remaining until maturity. Calculate the full price of the bond using\nactual days.\nStep 1: Calculate the value of the bond on the last coupon date (coupons are\nsemiannual, so we use 4/2 = 2% for the periodic discount rate):\nN = 4; PMT= 25; FV= 1,000; I/Y =2; CPT + PV= -1,019.04\nStep 2: Adjust for the number of days since the last coupon payment:\nDays between June 15 and December 15 = 183 days.\nDays between June 15 and settlement on August 21 = 67 days.\nFull price = 1,019.04 x (1.02)67/183 = 1,026.46.\n"}
