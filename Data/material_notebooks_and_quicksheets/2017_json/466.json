{"id": "466", "text": "Confidence interval estimates result in a range of values within which the actual value\nof a parameter will lie, given the probability of 1-a. Here, alpha, a, is called the level\nof significance for the confidence interval, and the probability 1-a is referred to as\nthe degree of confidence. For example, we might estimate that the population mean of\nrandom variables will range from 15 to 25 with a 95% degree of confidence, or at the\n5% level of significance.\n"}
