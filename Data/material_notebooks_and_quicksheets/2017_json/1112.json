{"id": "1112", "text": "Arguments for being concerned with the size of fiscal deficit:\nHigher deficits lead to higher future taxes. Higher future taxes will lead to\ndisincentives to work and entrepreneurship. This leads to lower long-term economic\ngrowth.\nIf markets lose confidence in the government, investors may not be willing to\nrefinance the debt. This can lead to the government defaulting (if debt is in a foreign\ncurrency) or having to simply print money (if the debt is in local currency). Printing\nmoney would ultimately lead to higher inflation.\nIncreased government borrowing will tend to increase interest rates, and firms may\nreduce their borrowing and investment spending as a result, decreasing the impact\non aggregate demand of deficit spending. This is referred to as the crowding-out\neffect because government borrowing is taking the place of private sector borrowing.\nArguments against being concerned with the size of fiscal deficit:\n\u2022 If the debt is primarily being held by domestic citizens, the scale of the problem is\noverstated.\nIf the debt is used to finance productive capital investment, future economic gains\nwill be sufficient to repay the debt.\nFiscal deficits may prompt needed tax reform.\nDeficits would not matter if private sector savings in anticipation of future tax\nliabilities just offsets the government deficit (Ricardian equivalence holds).\nIf the economy is operating at less than full capacity, deficits do not divert capital\naway from productive uses. On the contrary, deficits can aid in increasing GDP and\nemployment.\n"}
