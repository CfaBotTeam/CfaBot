{"id": "3335", "text": "Typically, neither party to the contract makes a payment at the initiation of a forward\ncontract. If the expected future price of the asset increases over the life of the contract,\nthe right to buy at the forward price (i.e., the price specified in the forward contract)\nwill have positive value, and the obligation to sell will have an equal negative value. If\nthe expected future price of the asset falls below the forward price, the result is opposite\nand the right to sell (at an above-market price) will have a positive value.\nThe party to the forward contract who agrees to buy the financial or physical asset has\na long forward position and is called the long. The party to the forward contract who\nagrees to sell or deliver the asset has a short forward position and is called the short.\n"}
