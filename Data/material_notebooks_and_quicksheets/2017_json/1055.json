The prices of all goods and wages could be indexed to this inflation rate\nso each month both wages and prices are increased approximately one-half percent.\nIncreased demand for a product would result in monthly price increases of more than\none-half percent and decreased demand would be reflected in prices that increased less\nthan one-half percent per month.\n"}
