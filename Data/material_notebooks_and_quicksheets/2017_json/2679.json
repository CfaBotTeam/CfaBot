{"id": "2679", "text": "Direct investing in the securities of foreign companies simply refers to buying a foreign\nfirm's securities in foreign markets. Some obstacles to direct foreign investment are that:\n\u2022 The investment and return are denominated in a foreign currency.\nThe foreign stock exchange may be illiquid.\nThe reporting requirements of foreign stock exchanges may be less strict, impeding\nanalysis.\nInvestors must be familiar with the regulations and procedures of each market in\nwhich they invest.\nOther methods for investing in foreign companies are provided by global depository\nreceipts (GDRs), American depository receipts (ADRs), global registered shares (GRSs),\nand baskets of listed depository receipts (BLDRs).\nDepository receipts (DRs) represent ownership in a foreign firm and are traded in the\nmarkets of other countries in local market currencies. A bank deposits shares of the\nforeign firm and then issues receipts representing ownership of a specific number of the\nforeign shares. The depository bank acts as a custodian and manages dividends, stock\nsplits, and other events. Although the investor does not have to convert to the foreign\ncurrency, the value of the DR is affected by exchange rate changes, as well as firm\nfundamentals, economic events, and any other factors that affect the value of any stock.\nIf the firm is involved with the issue, the depository receipt is a sponsored DR;\notherwise, it is an unsponsored DR. A sponsored DR provides the investor voting rights\nand is usually subject to greater disclosure requirements. In an unsponsored DR, the\ndepository bank retains the voting rights.\nGlobal depository receipts (GDRs) are issued outside the United States and the issuer's\nhome country. Most GDRs are traded on the London and Luxembourg exchanges.\nAlthough not listed on U.S. exchanges, they are usually denominated in U.S. dollars\n"}
