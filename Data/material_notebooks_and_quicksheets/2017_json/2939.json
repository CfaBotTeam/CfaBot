The NPV profiles for the two projects described in the previous example are\npresented in Figure 1. The project NPVs are summarized in the table below the graph.\nThe discount rates are on the x-axis of the NPV profile, and the corresponding NPVs\nare plotted on the y-axis.\nFigure 1: NPV Profiles\nNPV ($)\n"}
