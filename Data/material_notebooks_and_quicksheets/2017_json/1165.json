{"id": 1165, "text": "Since Portugal has a comparative advantage in the production of wine, England must\nhave a comparative advantage in the production of cloth. We can confirm this by noting\nthat the opportunity cost of cloth is 100 / 110 = 0.91 units of wine in England and 90 /\n80 = 1.125 units of wine in Portugal.\nThe conclusion is that, in the absence of trading costs, trade can make both countries\nbetter off by increasing total consumption of both goods in both countries. However, if\ntrading costs are high enough, they will prevent gains from trade. An important point\nof the analysis is that whether one country has an absolute advantage in the production\nof one or both goods, as long as the opportunity costs of the goods in each country are\ndifferent, there are possible gains from trade.\nAn example will illustrate the gains from trade in terms of expanded consumption\nopportunities for two countries. Figures 2 and 3 show the production possibility frontiers\n(PPF) for two countries, Alton and Borton, for two generic goods, food and machinery.\n"}
