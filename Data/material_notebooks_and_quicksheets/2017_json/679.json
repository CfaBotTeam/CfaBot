{"id": "679", "text": "Double top and triple top patterns are similar to the head-and-shoulders pattern in\nthat they indicate weakening in the buying pressure that has been driving an uptrend.\nIn both cases, the price reaches a resistance level at which selling pressure appears\nrepeatedly, preventing any further increase in the price. As with the head-and-shoulders,\nthe size of a double or triple top pattern can be used to project a price target for the next\ndowntrend.\n"}
