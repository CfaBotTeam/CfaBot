{"id": "3347", "text": "Many futures contracts have price limits, which are exchange-imposed limits on\nhow each day's settlement price can change from the previous day's settlement price.\nExchange members are prohibited from executing trades at prices outside these limits. If\nthe equilibrium price at which traders would willingly trade is above the upper limit or\nbelow the lower limit, trades cannot take place.\nConsider a futures contract that has a daily price limit of $0.02 and settled the previous\nday at $1.04. If, on the following trading day, traders wish to trade at $1.07 because of\nchanges in market conditions or expectations, no trades will take place. The settlement\nprice will be reported as $1.06 (for the purposes of marking-to-market). The contract\nwill be said to have made a limit move, and the price is said to be limit up (from the\nprevious day). If market conditions had changed such that the price at which traders are\nwilling to trade is below $1.02, $1.02 will be the settlement price, and the price is said\nto be limit down. If trades cannot take place because of a limit move, either up or down,\nthe price is said to be locked limit since no trades can take place and traders are locked\ninto their existing positions.\n"}
