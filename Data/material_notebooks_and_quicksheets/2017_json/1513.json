{"id": "1513", "text": "where:\nY/L = output per worker (labor productivity)\nK/L = physical capital per worker\nThis relationship suggests that labor productivity can be increased by either improving\ntechnology or increasing physical capital per worker.\nWe assume that the production function exhibits diminishing marginal productivity\nfor each individual input, meaning the amount of additional output produced by each\nadditional unit of input declines (holding the quantities of other inputs constant). For\nthis reason, sustainable long-term growth cannot necessarily be achieved simply by\ncapital deepening investment\u2014that is to say, increasing physical capital per worker over\ntime. Productivity gains and growth of the labor force are also necessary for long-term\nsustainable growth.\n"}
