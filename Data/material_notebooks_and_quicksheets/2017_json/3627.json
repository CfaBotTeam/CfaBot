{"id": "3627", "text": "Conversion value. This is the market value of the shares that would be received\nupon conversion. A bond with a conversion ratio of 25 shares when the current\nmarket price of a common share is $50 would have a conversion value of 25 x 50 =\n$1,250.\nEven if the share price increases to a level where the conversion value is significantly\nabove the bond's par value, bondholders might not convert the bonds to common stock\nuntil they must because the interest yield on the bonds is higher than the dividend yield\non the common shares received through conversion. For this reason, many convertible\nbonds have a call provision. Because the call price will be less than the conversion value\nof the shares, by exercising their call provision, the issuers can force bondholders to\nexercise their conversion option when the conversion value is significantly above the par\nvalue of the bonds.\n"}
