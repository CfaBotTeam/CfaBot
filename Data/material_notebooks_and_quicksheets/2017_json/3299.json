Bonds\nissued by nonsovereign government entities are repaid by either general taxes, revenues\nof a specific project (e.g., an airport), or by special taxes or fees dedicated to bond\nrepayment (e.g., a water district or sewer district).\nCorporate bonds are generally repaid from cash generated by the firm's operations. As\nnoted previously, securitized bonds are repaid from the cash flows of the financial assets\nowned by the SPE.\n"}
