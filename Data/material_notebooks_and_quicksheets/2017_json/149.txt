{"id": 149, "text": "A direct comparison between two or more measures of dispersion may be difficult. For\ninstance, suppose you are comparing the annual returns distribution for retail stocks\nwith a mean of 8% and an annual returns distribution for a real estate portfolio with\na mean of 16%. A direct comparison between the dispersion of the two distributions\nis not meaningful because of the relatively large difference in their means. To make\na meaningful comparison, a relative measure of dispersion must be used. Relative\ndispersion is the amount of variability in a distribution relative to a reference point or\nbenchmark. Relative dispersion is commonly measured with the coefficient of variation\n(CV), which is computed as:\n"}
