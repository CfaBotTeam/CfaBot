{"id": 2500, "text": "Trade visibility can also be specified. Hidden orders are those for which only the broker\nor exchange knows the trade size. These are useful for investors that have a large amount\nto trade and do not want to reveal their intentions. Traders can also specify display\nsize, where some of the trade is visible to the market, but the rest is not. These are also\nreferred to as iceberg orders because part of most of the order is hidden from view. They\nallow the investor to advertise some of the trade, with the rest of the trade potentially\nexecuted once the visible part has executed. Sometimes entering trades for part of the\nposition the trader wishes to establish is a way to estimate the liquidity of, or the buying\ninterest in, the security in question.\n"}
