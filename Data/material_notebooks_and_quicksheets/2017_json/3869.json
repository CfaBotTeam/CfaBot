{"id": "3869", "text": "Agency RMBS are mortgage pass-through securities. Each mortgage pass-through\nsecurity represents a claim on the cash flows from a pool of mortgages. Any number\nof mortgages may be used to form the pool, and any mortgage included in the pool is\nreferred to as a securitized mortgage. The mortgages in the pool typically have different\nmaturities and different mortgage rates. The weighted average maturity (WAM) of\nthe pool is equal to the weighted average of the final maturities of all the mortgages in\nthe pool, weighted by each mortgage's outstanding principal balance as a proportion\nof the total outstanding principal value of all the mortgages in the pool. The weighted\naverage coupon (WAC) of the pool is the weighted average of the interest rates of all\nthe mortgages in the pool. The investment characteristics of mortgage pass-through\nsecurities are a function of their cash flow features and the strength of the guarantee\nprovided.\n"}
