{"id": 1992, "text": "Intangible assets are long-term assets that lack physical substance, such as patents, brand\nnames, copyrights, and franchises. Some intangible assets have finite lives while others\nhave indefinite lives.\nThe cost of a finite-lived intangible asset is amortized over its useful life. Indefinite-lived\nintangible assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually. If\nimpaired, the reduction in value is recognized in the income statement as a loss in the\nperiod in which the impairment is recognized.\nIntangible assets are also considered either identifiable or unidentifiable. Under IFRS, an\nidentifiable intangible asset must be:\n\u2022 Capable of being separated from the firm or arise from a contractual or legal right.\n\u2022 Controlled by the firm\n\u2022 Expected to provide future economic benefits.\nIn addition, the future economic benefits must be probable and the asset's cost must be\nreliably measurable.\nAn unidentifiable intangible asset is one that cannot be purchased separately and may\nhave an indefinite life. The most common example of an unidentifiable intangible asset\nis goodwill. Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable\nassets (net of liabilities) acquired in a business combination.\nNot all intangible assets are reported on the balance sheet. Accounting for an intangible\nasset depends on whether the asset was created internally, purchased externally, or\nobtained as part of a business combination.\n"}
