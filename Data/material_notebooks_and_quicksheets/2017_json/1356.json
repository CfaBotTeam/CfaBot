{"id": 1356, "text": "Quantity\nQi Q.\nQuantity\nQ\u0131 fim Qe tim\nA firm's long-run adjustment to a shift in industry demand and the resulting change\nin price may be either to alter the size of its plant or leave the market entirely. The\nmarketplace abounds with examples of firms that have increased their plant sizes (or\nadded additional production facilities) to increase output in response to increasing\nmarket demand. Other firms, such as Ford and GM, have decreased plant size to reduce\neconomic losses. This strategy is commonly referred to as downsizing.\nIf an industry is characterized by firms earning economic profits, new firms will enter\nthe market. This will cause industry supply to increase (the industry supply curve shifts\ndownward and to the right), increasing equilibrium output and decreasing equilibrium\nprice. Even though industry output increases, however, individual firms will produce less\nbecause as price falls, each individual firm will move down its own supply curve. The\nend result is that a firm's total revenue and economic profit will decrease.\n"}
