Risk objectives can be either absolute (e.g., no losses greater than\n10% in any year) or relative (e.g., annual return will be within 2% of FTSE return).\nReturn objectives are typically based on an investor's desire to meet a future financial\ngoal, such as a particular level of income in retirement. Return objectives can be absolute\n(e.g., 9% annual return) or relative (e.g., outperform the S&P 500 by 2% per year).\nThe achievability of an investor's return expectations may be hindered by the investor's\nrisk objectives.\n"}
