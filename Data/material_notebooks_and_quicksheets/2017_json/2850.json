{"id": "2850", "text": "First, we must estimate the market value of the firm's short-term debt and liabilities.\nTo do so, subtract the book value of long-term debt from the book value of total\ndebt: $2,600,000 - $1,100,000 = $1,500,000. This is the book value of the firm's\nshort-term debt. We can assume the market value of these short-term items is close\nto their book value. (As we will see in the Study Session on fixed income valuation,\nthe market values of debt instruments approach their face values as they get close to\nmaturity.)\nAdd the market value of long-term debt to get the market value of total debt:\n$800,000 + $1,500,000 = $2,300,000.\n"}
