{"id": "1025", "text": "Exam Focus\nThis topic review covers the supply and demand for money, as well as fiscal and\nmonetary policy. This is a lot of material, but you really need to get it all down to be\nprepared for the exam. Concentrate initially on all the definitions and the basics of\nexpansionary and contractionary fiscal and monetary policy. When you read it the\nsecond time, try to understand every cause-and-effect relationship so you can trace the\neffects of a policy change through the economy. In this way, you will be able to answer\nquestions about the effect of, for example, open market purchases of securities by the\ncentral bank on interest rates, consumption, saving, private investment, and, of course,\nreal GDP in the short and long run. You should understand the role of the central bank\nin a developed economy, including its limitations in achieving its stated objectives.\n"}
