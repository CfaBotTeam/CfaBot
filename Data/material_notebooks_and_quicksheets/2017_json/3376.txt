{"id": 3376, "text": "Because the payoff at time T (expiration of the forward) is from a fully hedged position,\nits time T value is certain. To prevent arbitrage, the above equality must hold. If the net\ncost of buying the asset and selling the forward at time t is less than the present value\n(discounted at Rf) of the certain payoff at time T, an investor can borrow the funds (at\nRf) to buy the asset, sell the forward at time t, and earn a risk-free return in excess of\nRf. If the net cost is greater than the present value of the certain payoff at time T, an\narbitrageur could sell the hedged position (short the asset, invest the proceeds at Rf, and\nbuy the forward). At expiration, the asset can be purchased with the maturity payment\non the loan and the excess of that repayment over the forward price is a gain with no net\ninvestment over the period.\n"}
