{"id": 2571, "text": "Market Capitalization Weighting\nA market capitalization-weighted index is calculated by summing the total value (current\nstock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding) of all the stocks in the\nindex. This sum is then divided by a similar sum calculated during the selected base\nperiod. The ratio is then multiplied by the index's base value (typically 100).\nFor example, if the total market values of the index portfolio on December 31 and\nJanuary 31 are $80 million and $95 million, respectively, the index value at the end of\nJanuary is:\ncurrent total market value of index stocks\ncurrent index value =\n-x base year index value\nbase year total market value of index stocks\n"}
