{"id": 3084, "text": "1. C Business risk refers to the risk associated with a firm's operating income and is the\nresult of uncertainty about a firm's revenues and the expenditures necessary to produce\nthose revenues. Business risk is the combination of sales risk (the uncertainty associated\nwith the price and quantity of goods and services sold) and operating risk (the leverage\ncreated by the use of fixed costs in the firm's operations).\n2. C The extent to which costs are fixed determines operating leverage.\n3. C If fixed costs are a small percentage of total costs, operating leverage is low. Operating\nleverage is separate from financial leverage, which depends on the amount of debt in the\ncapital structure. Increasing the tax rate would make the after-tax cost of debt cheaper.\n4.
