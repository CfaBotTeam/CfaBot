{"id": "460", "text": "Student\u2019s t-distribution, or simply the t-distribution, is a bell-shaped probability\ndistribution that is symmetrical about its mean. It is the appropriate distribution to use\nwhen constructing confidence intervals based on small samples (n < 30) from populations\nwith unknown variance and a normal, or approximately normal, distribution. It may\nalso be appropriate to use the t-distribution when the population variance is unknown\nand the sample size is large enough that the central limit theorem will assure that the\nsampling distribution is approximately normal.\n"}
