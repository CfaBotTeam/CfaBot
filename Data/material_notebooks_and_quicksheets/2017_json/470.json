{"id": 470, "text": "Example: Confidence interval\nConsider a practice exam that was administered to 36 Level I candidates. The mean\nscore on this practice exam was 80. Assuming a population standard deviation equal\nto 15, construct and interpret a 99% confidence interval for the mean score on the\npractice exam for 36 candidates. Note that in this example the population standard\ndeviation is known, so we don't have to estimate it.\nAnswer:\nAt a confidence level of 99%, za/2 = 20.005 = 2.58. So, the 99% confidence interval is\ncalculated as follows:\n"}
