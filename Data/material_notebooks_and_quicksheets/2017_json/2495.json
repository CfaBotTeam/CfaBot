{"id": "2495", "text": "Execution Instructions\nThe most common orders, in terms of execution instructions, are market or limit orders.\nA market order instructs the broker to execute the trade immediately at the best possible\nprice. A limit order places a minimum execution price on sell orders and a maximum\nexecution price on buy orders. For example, a buy order with a limit of $6 will be\nexecuted immediately as long as the shares can be purchased for $6 or less.\nA market order is often appropriate when the trader wants to execute quickly, as\nwhen the trader has information she believes is not yet reflected in market prices. The\ndisadvantage of market orders is that they may execute at unfavorable prices, especially\nif the security has low trading volume relative to the order size. A market buy order\nmay execute at a high price or a market sell order may execute at a low price. Executing\nat an unfavorable price represents a concession by the trader for immediate liquidity.\nUnfortunately, these price concessions are unpredictable.\n"}
