{"id": 26, "text": "Exam Focus\nThis review has a mix of topics, but all are important and useful. You must be able to\nuse the cash flow functions on your calculator to calculate net present value and internal\nrate of return. We will use both of these in the Corporate Finance section and examine\ntheir strengths and weaknesses more closely there; but you must learn how to calculate\nthem here.

Don't hurry here; these concepts and techniques are\nfoundation material that turns up repeatedly at all three levels of the CFA\u00ae curriculum.\n"}
