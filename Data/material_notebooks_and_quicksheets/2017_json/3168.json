{"id": "3168", "text": "Another difference between calculating effective duration and the methods we have\ndiscussed so far is that the effects of changes in benchmark yields and changes in the\nyield spread for credit and liquidity risk are separated. Modified duration makes no\ndistinction between changes in the benchmark yield and changes in the spread. Effective\nduration reflects only the sensitivity of the bond's value to changes in the benchmark\nyield curve. Changes in the credit spread are sometimes addressed with a separate \u201ccredit\nduration\u201d measure.\n"}
