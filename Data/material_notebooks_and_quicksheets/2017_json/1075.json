{"id": 1075, "text": "The most common inflation rate target is 2%, with a permitted deviation of 41% so\nthe target band is 1% to 3%. The reason the inflation target is not 0% is that variations\naround that rate would allow for negative inflation (i.e., deflation), which is considered\ndisruptive to the smooth functioning of an economy. Central banks are not necessarily\ntargeting current inflation, which is the result of prior policy and events, but inflation in\nthe range of two years in the future.\n"}
