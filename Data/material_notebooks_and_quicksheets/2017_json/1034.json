When a bank makes a cash loan and the borrower spends the money,\nthe sellers who receive this cash may deposit it in banks as well. These funds can now be\nloaned out by these banks, except for the portion that must be held as reserves by each\nbank. This process of lending, spending, and depositing can continue until deposits are\nsome multiple of the original cash amount.\n"}
