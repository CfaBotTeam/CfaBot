{"id": 2942, "text": "The NPV profiles for projects A and B intersect because of a difference in the timing\nof the cash flows. Examining the cash flows for the projects (Table 1), we can see\nthat the total cash inflows for Project B are greater ($2,800) than those of Project A\n($2,600). Because they both have the same initial cost ($2,000) at a discount rate of\nzero, Project B has a greater NPV (2,800 - 2,000 = $800) than Project A (2,600 \u2013\n2,000 = $600).\n"}
