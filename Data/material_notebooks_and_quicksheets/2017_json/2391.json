{"id": 2391, "text": "In situations where ability is high but willingness is low, the adviser may attempt to\neducate the investor about investment risk and correct any misconceptions that may be\ncontributing to the investor's low stated willingness to take on investment risk. However,\nthe adviser's job is not to change the investor's personality characteristics that contribute\nto a low willingness to take on investment risk. The approach will most likely be to\nconform to the lower of the investor's ability or willingness to bear risk, as constructing\na portfolio with a level of risk that the client is clearly uncomfortable with will not likely\nlead to a good outcome in the investor's view.\n"}
