In the absence of any information\nindicating a change, an analyst may choose to incorporate the operating profit margin\nfrom the prior period into a pro forma income statement for the next period. Beginning\nwith an estimate of next-period sales, the estimated operating profit margin can be used\nto forecast operating profits for the next period.\nRather than point estimates of sales and net and operating margins, the analyst may\nexamine possible changes in order to create a range of possible values for key financial\nvariables.\n"}
