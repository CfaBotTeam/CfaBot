The buy\nside includes corporations, real money and leveraged investment accounts, governments\nand government entities, and retail purchasers of foreign currencies.\n3. B 1/1.311 = 0.7628 GBP/USD.\n4. C The CAD has appreciated because it is worth a larger number of JPY. The percent\nappreciation is (78 - 75) / 75 = 4.0%. To calculate the percentage depreciation of the\nJPY against the CAD, convert the exchange rates to direct quotations for Japan: 1775 =\n0.0133 CAD/JPY and 1178 = 0.0128 CAD/JPY. Percentage depreciation = (0.0128 \u2013\n0.0133) / 0.0133 = -3.8%.\n5. A Start with one NZD and exchange for 1/ 1.6 = 0.625 USD. Exchange the USD for\n0.625 x 2,400 = 1,500 IDR. We get a cross rate of 1,500 IDR/NZD or 1/1,500 =\n0.00067 NZD/IDR.\n6. A USD/NZD 0.3500 x NZD/SEK 0.3100 = USD/SEK 0.1085.\nNotice that the NZD term cancels in the multiplication.\n7. B The 180-day forward exchange rate is 1.3050 \u2013 0.00425 = CHF/GBP 1.30075.\n8. B To calculate a percentage forward premium or discount for the U.S. dollar, we need\nthe dollar to be the base currency. The spot and forward quotes given are U.S. dollars\nper British pound (USDIGBP), so we must invert them to GBP/USD. The spot GBPI\nUSD price is 1/1.533 = 0.6523 and the forward GBP/USD price is 1/ 1.508 = 0.6631.\nBecause the forward price is greater than the spot price, we say the dollar is at a forward\npremium of 0.6631 i 0.6523 \u2013 1 = 1.66%. Alternatively, we can calculate this premium\nwith the given quotes as spot/forward -1 to get 1.533 / 1.508 \u2013 1 = 1.66%.\n9. B The forward rate in SEK/USD is 9.52\n:9.7985. Since the SEK interest rate is\nthe higher of the two, the SEK must depreciate approximately 3%.\n10. A We can solve interest rate parity for the spot rate as follows:\nWith the exchange rates quoted as USDICHF, the spot is 0.80| 0\n= 0.7564. Since\n"}
