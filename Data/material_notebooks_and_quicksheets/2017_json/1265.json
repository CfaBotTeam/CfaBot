{"id": "1265", "text": "where:\nY = domestic production of goods and services or national income\nE = domestic absorption of goods and services, which is total expenditure\nBT = balance of trade\nViewed in this way, we can see that income relative to expenditure must increase\n(domestic absorption must fall) for the balance of trade to improve in response to a\ncurrency depreciation. For the balance of trade to improve, domestic saving must increase\nrelative to domestic investment in physical capital (which is a component of E). Thus,\nfor a depreciation of the domestic currency to improve the balance of trade towards\nsurplus, it must increase national income relative to expenditure. We can also view this\nas a requirement that national saving increase relative to domestic investment in physical\ncapital.\n"}
