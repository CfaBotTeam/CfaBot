{"id": "1279", "text": "Exchange rate regimes for countries that have their own currency:\nA currency board arrangement is an explicit commitment to exchange domestic\ncurrency for a specified foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate.\nIn a conventional fixed peg arrangement, a country pegs its currency within margins of\n+1% versus another currency.\nIn a system of pegged exchange rates within horizontal bands or a target zone, the\npermitted fluctuations in currency value relative to another currency or basket of\ncurrencies are wider (e.g., +2 %).\nWith a crawling peg, the exchange rate is adjusted periodically, typically to adjust for\nhigher inflation versus the currency used in the peg.\nWith management of exchange rates within crawling bands, the width of the bands\nthat identify permissible exchange rates is increased over time.\nWith a system of managed floating exchange rates, the monetary authority attempts to\ninfluence the exchange rate in response to specific indicators, such as the balance of\npayments, inflation rates, or employment without any specific target exchange rate.\nWhen a currency is independently floating, the exchange rate is market-determined.\n"}
