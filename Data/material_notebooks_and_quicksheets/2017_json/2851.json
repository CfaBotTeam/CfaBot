{"id": "2851", "text": "Our third category of valuation model is asset-based models, which are based on the\nidea that equity value is the market or fair value of assets minus the market or fair\nvalue of liabilities. Because market values of firm assets are usually difficult to obtain,\nthe analyst typically starts with the balance sheet to determine the values of assets and\nliabilities. In most cases, market values are not equal to book values. Possible approaches\nto valuing assets are to value them at their depreciated values, inflation-adjusted\ndepreciated values, or estimated replacement values.\n"}
