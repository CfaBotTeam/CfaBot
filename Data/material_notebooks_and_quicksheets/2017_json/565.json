{"id": 565, "text": "Below, we present a summary of each subsection of the Standards of Professional\nConduct. For each one, we first detail actions that violate the Standard and then list\nactions and behaviors that are recommended within the Standards. We suggest you learn\nthe violations especially well so you understand that the other items are recommended.\nFor the exam, it is not necessary to memorize the Standard number and subsection\nletter. Knowing that an action violates, for example, Professionalism, rather than Duties\nto Employers or Duties to Clients, should be sufficient in this regard. Note that some\nactions may violate more than one Standard.\n"}
