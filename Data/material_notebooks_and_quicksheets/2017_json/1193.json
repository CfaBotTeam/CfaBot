{"id": "1193", "text": "\u2022 Foreign-owned assets in the country are divided into foreign official assets and other\nforeign assets in the domestic country. These assets include domestic government\nand corporate securities, direct investment in the domestic country, domestic\ncountry currency, and domestic liabilities to foreigners reported by domestic banks.\nA country that has imports valued more than its exports is said to have a current account\n(trade) deficit, while countries with more exports than imports are said to have a current\naccount surplus. For a country with a trade deficit, it must be balanced by a net surplus\nin the capital and financial accounts. As a result, investment analysts often think of\nall financing flows as a single capital account that combines items in the capital and\nfinancial accounts. Thinking in this way, any deficit in the current account must be\nmade up by a surplus in the combined capital account. That is, the excess of imports\nover exports must be offset by sales of assets and debt incurred to foreign entities. A\ncurrent account surplus is similarly offset by purchases of foreign physical or financial\nassets.\n"}
