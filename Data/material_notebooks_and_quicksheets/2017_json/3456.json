{"id": 3456, "text": "LOS 58.f\nBecause gains and losses on futures contracts are settled daily, prices of forwards and\nfutures that have the same terms may be different if interest rates are correlated with\nfutures prices. Futures are more valuable than forwards when interest rates and futures\nprices are positively correlated and less valuable when they are negatively correlated. If\ninterest rates are constant or uncorrelated with futures prices, the prices of futures and\nforwards are the same.\n"}
