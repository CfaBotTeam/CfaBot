{"id": 1355, "text": "price will change the (horizontal) demand curve faced by each individual firm and\nthe profit-maximizing output of a firm. These effects for an increase in demand are\nillustrated in Figure 8. An increase in market demand from D, to D, increases the shortrun equilibrium price from P, to P, and equilibrium output from Q, to Q,. In Panel (6)\nof Figure 8, we see the short-run effect of the increased market price on the output of an\nindividual firm. The higher price leads to a greater profit-maximizing output, Q2 Firm\"\nAt the higher output level, a firm will earn an economic profit in the short run. In the\nlong run, some firms will increase their scale of operations in response to the increase\nin demand, and new firms will likely enter the industry. In response to a decrease in\ndemand, the short-run equilibrium price and quantity will fall, and in the long run,\nfirms will decrease their scale of operations or exit the market.\n"}
