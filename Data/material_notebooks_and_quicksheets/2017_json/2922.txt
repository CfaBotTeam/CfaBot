{"id": 2922, "text": "To calculate the IRR, you may use the trial-and-error method. That is, just keep\nguessing IRRs until you get the right one, or you may use a financial calculator.\nIRR decision rule: First, determine the required rate of return for a given project. This\nis usually the firm's cost of capital. Note that the required rate of return may be higher\nor lower than the firm's cost of capital to adjust for differences between project risk\nand the firm's average project risk.\nIf IRR > the required rate of return, accept the project.\nIF IRR < the required rate of return, reject the project.\n"}
