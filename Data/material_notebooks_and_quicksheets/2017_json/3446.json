{"id": 3446, "text": "This disadvantage to bondholders can be seen by considering the case where interest\nrates have fallen since bond issuance, so the bonds are trading at a price above the\nsinking fund redemption price. In this case, the bond trustee will select outstanding\nbonds for redemption randomly. A bondholder would suffer a loss if her bonds were\nselected to be redeemed at a price below the current market price. This means the bonds\nhave more reinvestment risk because bondholders who have their bonds redeemed can\nonly reinvest the funds at the new, lower yield (assuming they buy bonds of similar risk).\n"}
