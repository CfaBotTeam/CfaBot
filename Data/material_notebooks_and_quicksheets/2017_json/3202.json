{"id": "3202", "text": "The term structure of yield volatility refers to the relation between the volatility of\nbond yields and their times to maturity. We have seen that the sensitivity of a bond's\nprice with respect to a given change in yield depends on its duration and convexity. From\nan investor's point of view, it's the volatility of a bond's price that is of concern. The\nvolatility of a bond's price has two components: the sensitivity of the bond's price to a\ngiven change in yield and the volatility of the bond's yield.\nIn calculating duration and convexity, we implicitly assumed that the yield curve shifted\nin a parallel manner. In practice, this is often not the case. For example, changes in\nmonetary policy may have more of an effect on short-term interest rates than on longer"}
