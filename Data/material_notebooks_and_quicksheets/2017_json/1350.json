{"id": 1350, "text": "In a perfectly competitive market, firms will not earn economic profits for any significant\nperiod of time. The assumption is that new firms (with average and marginal cost curves\nidentical to those of existing firms) will enter the industry to earn economic profits,\nincreasing market supply and eventually reducing market price so that it just equals\nfirms' average total cost (ATC). In equilibrium, each firm is producing the quantity for\nwhich P = MR = MC = ATC, so that no firm earns economic profits and each firm is\nproducing the quantity for which ATC is a minimum (the quantity for which ATC =\nMC). This equilibrium situation is illustrated in Figure 5.\n"}
