For a firm in a perfectly competitive market,\nthis is the same as producing and selling the quantity for which marginal cost equals\n(market) price. Economic profit equals total revenues less the opportunity cost of\nproduction, which includes the cost of a normal return to all factors of production,\nincluding invested capital.\n"}
