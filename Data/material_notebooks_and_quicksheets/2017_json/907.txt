{"id": 907, "text": "Future Value of an Annuity Due\nSometimes it is necessary to find the FV of an annuity due (FVAD), an annuity where\nthe annuity payments (or deposits) occur at the beginning of each compounding\nperiod. Fortunately, our financial calculators can be used to do this, but with one slight\nmodification\u2014the calculator must be set to the beginning-of-period (BGN) mode. To\nswitch between the BGN and END modes on the TI, press (2nd) (BGN) (2nd) (SET).\nWhen this is done, \u201cBGN\u201d will appear in the upper right corner of the display window.\nIf the display indicates the desired mode, press [2nd] [QUIT). You will normally want\nyour calculator to be in the ordinary annuity (END) mode, so remember to switch out\nof BGN mode after working annuity due problems. Note that nothing appears in the\nupper right corner of the display window when the TI is set to the END mode. It should\nbe mentioned that while annuity due payments are made or received at the beginning of\neach period, the FV of an annuity due is calculated as of the end of the last period.\n"}
