{"id": 3913, "text": "The CDO structure typically is to issue a floating-rate senior tranche that is 70-80%\nof the total and a smaller mezzanine tranche that pays a fixed rate of interest. If the\nsecurities in the collateral pool pay a fixed rate of interest, the collateral manager may\nenter into an interest rate swap that pays a floating rate of interest in exchange for a fixed\nrate of interest in order to make the collateral yield more closely match the funding costs\nin an environment of changing interest rates. The term arbitrage CDO is used for CDOs\nstructured to earn returns from the spread between funding costs and portfolio returns.\nThe collateral manager may use interest earned on portfolio securities, cash from\nmaturing portfolio securities, and cash from the sale of portfolio securities to cover the\npromised payments to holders of the CDOs senior and mezzanine bonds.\n"}
