{"id": 1652, "text": "Arguments in favor of Each Method\nThe primary advantage of the direct method is that it presents the firm's operating cash\nreceipts and payments, while the indirect method only presents the net result of these\nreceipts and payments. Therefore, the direct method provides more information than the\nindirect method. This knowledge of past receipts and payments is useful in estimating\nfuture operating cash flows.\nThe main advantage of the indirect method is that it focuses on the differences in net\nincome and operating cash flow. This provides a useful link to the income statement\nwhen forecasting future operating cash flow. Analysts forecast net income and then\nderive operating cash flow by adjusting net income for the differences between accrual\naccounting and the cash basis of accounting.\n"}
