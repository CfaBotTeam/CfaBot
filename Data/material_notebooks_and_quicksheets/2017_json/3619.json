{"id": "3619", "text": "Compounding Frequency\nSometimes the \u201crate\u201d on an investment is expressed as a simple annual rate (or stated\nrate)\u2014the annual rate with no compounding of returns. The number of compounding\nperiods per year is called the periodicity of the rate. For a periodicity of one, the stated\nrate and the effective annual rate are the same. When the periodicity is greater than one\n(more than one compounding period per year), the effective annual rate is the effective\nrate for the sub-periods, compounded for the number of sub-periods.\n"}
