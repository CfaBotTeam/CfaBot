The intuition here\nis that the firm should undertake all those projects with IRRs greater than the cost of\nfunds, the same criterion developed in the capital budgeting topic review. This will\nmaximize the value created. At the same time, no projects with IRRs less than the\nmarginal cost of the additional capital required to fund them should be undertaken, as\nthey will erode the value created by the firm.\n"}
