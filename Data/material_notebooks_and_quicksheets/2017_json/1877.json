{"id": "1877", "text": "Cost is the basis for most inventory valuation. The main issue involves determining the\namounts that should be included in cost.\nThe costs included in inventory are similar under IFRS and U.S. GAAP. These costs,\nknown as product costs, are capitalized in the Inventories account on the balance sheet\nand include:\n\u2022 Purchase cost less trade discounts and rebates.\nConversion (manufacturing) costs including labor and overhead.\nOther costs necessary to bring the inventory to its present location and condition.\nBy capitalizing inventory cost as an asset, expense recognition is delayed until the\ninventory is sold and revenue is recognized.\n"}
