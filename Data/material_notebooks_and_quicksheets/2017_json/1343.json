{"id": 1343, "text": "good example of monopolistic competition. Firms differentiate their products through\nfeatures and marketing with claims of more attractiveness, whiter teeth, fresher breath,\nand even of actually cleaning your teeth and preventing decay. If the price of your\npersonal favorite increases, you are not likely to immediately switch to another brand as\nunder perfect competition. Some customers would switch in response to a 10% increase\nin price and some would not. This is why firm demand is downward sloping.\nThe most important characteristic of an oligopoly market is that there are only a few\nfirms competing. In such a market, each firm must consider the actions and responses\nof other firms in setting price and business strategy. We say that such firms are\ninterdependent. While products are typically good substitutes for each other, they may\nbe either quite similar or differentiated through features, branding, marketing, and\nquality. Barriers to entry are high, often because economies of scale in production or\nmarketing lead to very large firms. Demand can be more or less elastic than for firms\nin monopolistic competition. The automobile market is dominated by a few very large\nfirms and can be characterized as an oligopoly. The product and pricing decisions of\nToyota certainly affect those of Ford and vice versa. Automobile makers compete based\non price, but also through marketing, product features, and quality, which is often\nsignaled strongly through brand name. The oil industry also has a few dominant firms\nbut their products are very good substitutes for each other.\nA monopoly market is characterized by a single seller of a product with no close\nsubstitutes. This fact alone means that the firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve\n(the market demand curve) and has the power to choose the price at which it sells its\nproduct. High barriers to entry protect a monopoly producer from competition. One\nsource of monopoly power is the protection offered by copyrights and patents. Another\npossible source of monopoly power is control over a resource specifically needed to\nproduce the product. Most frequently, monopoly power is supported by government.\nA natural monopoly refers to a situation where the average cost of production is\nfalling over the relevant range of consumer demand. In this case, having two (or more)\nproducers would result in a significantly higher cost of production and be detrimental to\nconsumers. Examples of natural monopolies include the electric power and distribution\nbusiness and other public utilities. When privately owned companies are granted such\nmonopoly power, the price they charge is often regulated by government as well.\nSometimes market power is the result of network effects or synergies that make it very\ndifficult to compete with a company once it has reached a critical level of market\npenetration. EBay gained such a large share of the online auction market that its\ninformation on buyers and sellers and the number of buyers who visit eBay essentially\nprecluded others from establishing competing businesses. While it may have competition\nto some degree, its market share is such that it has negatively sloped demand and a good\ndeal of pricing power. Sometimes we refer to such companies as having a moat around\nthem that protects them from competition. It is best to remember, however, that changes\nin technology and consumer tastes can, and usually do, reduce market power over time.\nPolaroid had a monopoly on instant photos for years, but the introduction of digital\nphotography forced the firm into bankruptcy in 2001.\n"}
