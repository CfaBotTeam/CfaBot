{"id": 3864, "text": "Some loans have no penalty for prepayment of principal while others have a prepayment\npenalty. A prepayment penalty is an additional payment that must be made if principal\nis prepaid during an initial period after loan origination or, for some mortgages, prepaid\nanytime during the life of the mortgage. A prepayment penalty benefits the lender by\nproviding compensation when the loan is paid off early because market interest rates\nhave decreased since the mortgage loan was made (i.e., loans are refinanced at a lower\ninterest rate).\n"}
