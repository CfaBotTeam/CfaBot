{"id": "164", "text": "A distribution is said to exhibit excess kurtosis if it has either more or less kurtosis than\nthe normal distribution. The computed kurtosis for all normal distributions is three.\nStatisticians, however, sometimes report excess kurtosis, which is defined as kurtosis\nminus three. Thus, a normal distribution has excess kurtosis equal to zero, a leptokurtic\ndistribution has excess kurtosis greater than zero, and platykurtic distributions will have\nexcess kurtosis less than zero.\n"}
