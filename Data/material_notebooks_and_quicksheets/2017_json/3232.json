B Duration gap is Macaulay duration minus the investment horizon. Because modified\nduration equals Macaulay duration / (1 + YTM), Macaulay duration is greater than\nmodified duration for any YTM greater than zero. Therefore, this bond has a Macaulay\nduration greater than six years and the investment has a positive duration gap.\n15. C The less liquidity a bond has, the higher its yield spread relative to its benchmark. This\nis because investors require a higher yield to compensate them for giving up liquidity.\n16. A The price of the bond after three years that will generate neither a capital gain nor a\ncapital loss is the price if the YTM remains at 7.3%. After three years, the present value\nof the bond is 800,000 / 1.07312 = 343,473.57, so she will have a capital gain relative to\nthe bond's carrying value.\n"}
