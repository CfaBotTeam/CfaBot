{"id": "156", "text": "Analysts should be aware of two limitations of the Sharpe ratio: (1) If two portfolios\nhave negative Sharpe ratios, it is not necessarily true that the higher Sharpe ratio implies\nsuperior risk-adjusted performance. Increasing risk moves a negative Sharpe ratio\ncloser to zero (i.e., higher). (2) The Sharpe ratio is useful when standard deviation is an\nappropriate measure of risk. However, investment strategies with option characteristics\nhave asymmetric return distributions, reflecting a large probability of small gains\ncoupled with a small probability of large losses. In such cases, standard deviation may\nunderestimate risk and produce Sharpe ratios that are too high.\n"}
