{"id": 366, "text": "normal distribution. In the area of investment and portfolio management, the normal\ndistribution plays a central role in portfolio theory.\nThe normal distribution has the following key properties:\n\u2022 It is completely described by its mean, pu, and variance, o?, stated as X - N(0, 02).\nIn words, this says that \u201cX is normally distributed with mean u and variance o?.\u201d\nSkewness = 0, meaning that the normal distribution is symmetric about its mean, so\nthat P(X < 0) = P(u < X) = 0.5, and mean = median = mode.\nKurtosis = 3; this is a measure of how flat the distribution is. Recall that excess\nkurtosis is measured relative to 3, the kurtosis of the normal distribution.\nA linear combination of normally distributed random variables is also normally\ndistributed.\nThe probabilities of outcomes further above and below the mean get smaller and\nsmaller but do not go to zero (the tails get very thin but extend infinitely).\nMany of these properties are evident from examining the graph of a normal distribution's\nprobability density function as illustrated in Figure 5.\nFigure 5: Normal Distribution Probability Density Function\n"}
