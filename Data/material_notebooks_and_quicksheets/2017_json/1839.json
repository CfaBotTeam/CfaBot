{"id": "1839", "text": "Credit Analysis\nCredit analysis is based on many of the ratios that we have already covered in this\nreview. In assessing a company's ability to service and repay its debt, analysts use interest\ncoverage ratios (calculated with EBIT or EBITDA), return on capital, and debt-to-assets\nratios. Other ratios focus on various measures of cash flow to total debt.\nRatios have been used to analyze and predict firm bankruptcies. Altman (2000)\ndeveloped a Z-score that is useful in predicting firm bankruptcies (a low score indicates\nhigh probability of failure). The predictive model was based on a firm's working capital\nto assets, retained earnings to assets, EBIT to assets, market to book value of a share of\nstock, and revenues to assets.\n"}
