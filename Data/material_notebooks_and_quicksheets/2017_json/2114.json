{"id": 2114, "text": "Sources of Short-Term Funding From Banks\nLines of credit are used primarily by large, financially sound companies.\n\u2022 Uncommitted line of credit. A bank extends an offer of credit for a certain amount\nbut may refuse to lend if circumstances change.\nCommitted (regular) line of credit. A bank extends an offer of credit that it \u201ccommits\nto\u201d for some period of time. The fact that the bank has committed to extend credit\nin amounts up to the credit line makes this a more reliable source of short-term\nfunding than an uncommitted line of credit. Banks charge a fee for making such\na commitment. Loans under the agreement are typically for periods of less than a\nyear, and interest charges are stated in terms of a short-term reference rate, such as\nLIBOR or the U.S. prime rate, plus a margin to compensate for the credit risk of\nthe loan. Outside the United States, similar arrangements are referred to as overdraft\nlines of credit.\nRevolving line of credit. An even more reliable source of short-term financing than\na committed line of credit, revolving lines of credit are typically for longer terms,\nsometimes as long as years. Along with committed lines of credit, revolving credit\nlines can be verified and can be listed on a firm's financial statements in the footnotes\nas a source of liquidity.\nCompanies with weaker credit may have to pledge assets as collateral for bank\nborrowings. Fixed assets, inventory, and accounts receivable may all serve as collateral\nfor loans. Short-term financing is typically collateralized by receivables or inventory\nand longer-term loans are secured with a claim to fixed (longer-term) assets. The bank\nmay also have a blanket lien which gives it a claim to all current and future firm assets as\ncollateral in case the primary collateral is insufficient and the borrowing firm defaults.\nWhen a firm assigns its receivables to the bank making a loan, the company still services\nthe receivables and remains responsible for any receivables that are not paid.\n"}
