{"id": "606", "text": "Note that the chi-square values in Figure 8 correspond to the probabilities in the right\ntail of the distribution. As such, the 16.791 in Figure 7 is from the column headed\n0.975 because 95% + 2.5% of the probability is to the right of it. The 46.979 is from\nthe column headed 0.025 because only 2.5% probability is to the right of it. Similarly,\nat a 5% level of significance with 10 degrees of freedom, Figure 8 shows that the critical\nchi-square values for a two-tailed test are 3.247 and 20.483.\n"}
