{"id": 2062, "text": "Revaluing an asset\u2019s value upward will result in:\nHigher total assets and higher shareholders' equity.\nLower leverage ratios as measured by the debt ratio (total debt / total assets) and the\ndebt-to-equity ratio (higher denominators).\nHigher depreciation expense and thus lower profitability in periods after revaluation.\nLower ROA and ROE in periods after revaluation (lower numerators and higher\ndenominators). However, if the increase in the asset value is the result of higher\noperating capacity, such higher capacity should result in higher revenues and thus\nhigher earnings.\nAn analyst should check the source of the appraisal that supports the revaluation.\nAppraisals from independent sources are usually more reliable than appraisals by\nmanagement.\n"}
