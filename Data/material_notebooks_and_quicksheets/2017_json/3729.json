{"id": 3729, "text": "Calculating the value of an Annual Coupon Bond\nThe value of a coupon bond can be calculated by summing the present values of all of\nthe bond's promised cash flows. The market discount rate appropriate for discounting a\nbond's cash flows is called the bond's yield-to-maturity (YTM) or redemption yield. If\nwe know a bond's yield-to-maturity, we can calculate its value, and if we know its value\n(market price), we can calculate its yield-to-maturity.\nConsider a newly issued 10-year, $1,000 par value, 10% coupon, annual-pay bond. The\ncoupon payments will be $100 at the end of each year the $1,000 par value will be paid\nat the end of year 10. First, let's value this bond assuming the appropriate discount rate\nis 10%. The present value of the bond's cash flows discounted at 10% is:\n100, 100, 100\n100 1,100\nC++-\n1.11.121.13\nThe calculator solution is:\n"}
