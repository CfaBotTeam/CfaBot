{"id": 1099, "text": "To understand the calculation of the multiplier effect, consider an increase in\ngovernment spending of $100 when the MPC is 80%, and the tax rate is 25%. The\nincrease in spending increases incomes by $100, but $25 (100 x 0.25) of that will be\npaid in taxes. Disposable income is equal to income after taxes, so disposable income\nincreases by $100 x (1 - 0.25) = $75. With an MPC of 80%, additional spending by\nthose who receive the original $100 increase is $75 x 0.8 = $60.\n"}
