{"id": 691, "text": "An index value close to one suggests funds are flowing about evenly to advancing\nand declining stocks. Index values greater than one mean the majority of volume\nis in declining stocks, while an index less than one means more of the volume is\nin advancing stocks. On charts of the TRIN for U.S. stocks, spikes upward have\ncoincided with large daily losses in the stock market, while spikes downward have\ncoincided with large daily gains in the stock market.\nMargin debt, besides indicating investor sentiment as described above, is also a useful\nflow of funds indicator. Increasing margin debt may indicate that investors want to\nbuy more stocks. Decreasing margin debt indicates increased selling.\nThe mutual fund cash position is the ratio of mutual funds' cash to total assets.\nDuring uptrends, fund managers want to invest cash quickly because cash earns only\nthe risk-free rate of return and thus decreases fund returns. During downtrends,\nfund cash balances increase overall fund returns. As a result, mutual fund cash\npositions tend to increase when the market is falling and decrease when the market\nis rising. Technical analysts typically view mutual fund cash as a contrarian indicator.\nWhen mutual funds accumulate cash, this represents future buying power in the\nmarket. A high mutual fund cash ratio therefore suggests market prices are likely\nto increase. On the other hand, when mutual funds' cash is low, they are already\ninvested and market prices reflect their purchases.\n"}
