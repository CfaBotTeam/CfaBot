{"id": "3416", "text": "At any point during the life of an option, its value will typically be greater than its\nintrinsic value. This is because there is some probability that the underlying asset price\nwill change in an amount that gives the option a positive payoff at expiration greater\nthan the (current) intrinsic value. Recall that an option's intrinsic value (to a buyer) is\nthe amount of the payoff at expiration and is bounded by zero.\n"}
