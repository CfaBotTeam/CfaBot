{"id": 705, "text": "theorists believe that the ratios of Fibonacci numbers are useful for estimating price\ntargets. For example, a down leg can be 1/2 or 2/3 the size of an up leg, or a price target\ncan be 13/18 of the previous high. Ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers converge\nto 0.618 and 1.618 as the numbers in the sequence get larger. These two values are\ncommonly used to project price targets.\n"}
