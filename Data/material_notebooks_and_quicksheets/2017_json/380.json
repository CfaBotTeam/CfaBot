{"id": 380, "text": "that F(-Z) = 1- F(Z). The tables in the back of many texts actually provide probabilities\nfor negative z-values, but we will work with only the positive portion of the table\nbecause this may be all you get on the exam. In Figure 7, we can find the probability\nthat a standard normal random variable will be less than 1.66, for example. The table\nvalue is 95.15%. The probability that the random variable will be less than -1.66 is\nsimply 1 - 0.9515 = 0.0485 = 4.85%, which is also the probability that the variable will\nbe greater than +1.66.\nProfessor's Note: When you use the standard normal probabilities, you have\nformulated the problem in terms of standard deviations from the mean.\nConsider a security with returns that are approximately normal, an expected\nreturn of 10%, and standard deviation of returns of 12%. The probability\nof returns greater than 30% is calculated based on the number of standard\ndeviations that 30% is above the expected return of 10%. 30% is 20% above\nthe expected return of 10%, which is 20 / 12 = 1.67 standard deviations\nabove the mean. We look up the probability of returns less than 1.67 standard\ndeviations above the mean (0.9525 or 95.25% from Figure 7) and calculate the\nprobability of returns more than 1.67 standard deviations above the mean as\n1 - 0.9525 = 4.75%.\n"}
