A party may enter into\nthe contract to speculate on the future price of an asset, but more often a party seeks to\nenter into a forward contract to hedge an existing exposure to the risk of asset price or\ninterest rate changes. A forward contract can be used to reduce or eliminate uncertainty\nabout the future price of an asset it plans to buy or sell at a later date.\n"}
