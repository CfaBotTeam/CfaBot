{"id": "986", "text": "Analysts who look for emerging trends in consumer prices are often interested in the\nprices of goods in process. Widespread price increases for producers' goods may be\npassed along to consumers. For most major economies, a producer price index (PPI)\nor wholesale price index (WPI) is available. Analysts can observe the PPI for different\nstages of processing (raw materials, intermediate goods, and finished goods) to watch for\nemerging price pressure. Sub-indexes of the PPI are also useful for identifying changes\nin relative prices of producers' inputs, which may indicate shifts in demand among\nindustries.\n"}
