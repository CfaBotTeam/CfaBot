{"id": 566, "text": "One way to write questions for this material is to offer a reason that might make one\nbelieve a Standard does not apply in a particular situation. In most, if not all, cases the\n\"reason\u201d does not change the requirement of the Standard. If you are prohibited from\nsome action, the motivations for the action or other circumstances simply do not matter.\nIf the Standard says it\u2019s a violation, it's a violation. An exception is when intent is key to\nthe Standard, such as intending to mislead clients or market participants in general.\n"}
