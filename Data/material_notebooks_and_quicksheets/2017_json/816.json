{"id": 816, "text": "Our live online classes for the June exam begin in October for candidates who want\nto start their study early. In January we offer three different live weekly online classes,\npresented in the evening based on New York time, London time, or Hong Kong time.\nAll of our live online classes are archived and available on-demand through the exam\ndate for those who prefer a different day or time of day for their classes. Although\nthey cover essentially the same material as the video lectures, the live classes offer more\nintegration of the curriculum material, more practice questions, and more instruction\nfocused on exam preparation and the ways the material may be tested.\n"}
