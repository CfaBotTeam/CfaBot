{"id": 353, "text": "Some intuition about these results may help you remember the calculations. Consider\nthat a (very large) bowl of black and white beans has 60% black beans and that each\ntime you select a bean, you replace it in the bowl before drawing again. We want to\nknow the probability of selecting exactly three black beans in five draws, as in the\nprevious example.\nOne way this might happen is BBBWW. Since the draws are independent, the\nprobability of this is easy to calculate. The probability of drawing a black bean is\n60%, and the probability of drawing a white bean is 1 - 60% = 40%. Therefore, the\nprobability of selecting BBBWW, in order, is 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4 = 3.456%.\nThis is the p\u00ba (1 - p)? from the formula and p is 60%, the probability of selecting a\nblack bean on any single draw from the bowl. BBBWW is not, however, the only way\nto choose exactly three black beans in five trials. Another possibility is BBWWB, and a\nthird is BWWBB. Each of these will have exactly the same probability of occurring as\nour initial outcome, BBBWw. That's why we need to answer the question of how many\nways (different orders) there are for us to choose three black beans in five draws. Using\nthe formula, there are =\n=10 ways; 10 x 3.456% = 34.56%, the answer we\ncomputed above. 3!(5-3)!\n"}
