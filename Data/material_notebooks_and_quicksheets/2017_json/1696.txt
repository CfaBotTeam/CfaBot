{"id": 1696, "text": "Major Sources and Uses of Cash\nCash flow analysis begins with an evaluation of the firm's sources and uses of cash from\noperating, investing, and financing activities. Sources and uses of cash change as the\nfirm moves through its life cycle. For example, when a firm is in the early stages of\ngrowth, it may experience negative operating cash flow as it uses cash to finance increases\nin inventory and receivables. This negative operating cash flow is usually financed\nexternally by issuing debt or equity securities. These sources of financing are not\nsustainable. Eventually, the firm must begin generating positive operating cash flow or\nthe sources of external capital may no longer be available. Over the long term, successful\nfirms must be able to generate operating cash flows that exceed capital expenditures and\nprovide a return to debt and equity holders.\n"}
