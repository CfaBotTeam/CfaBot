{"id": "3388", "text": "We can denote the present value of any costs of holding the asset from time o to\nexpiration at time Tas PV, (cost) and the present value of any cash flows from the asset\nand any convenience yield over the holding period as PV, (benefit).\nConsider first a case where there are costs of holding the asset but no benefits. The asset\ncan be purchased now and held to time T'at a total cost of [S, + PV, (cost)] (1 + Rf)T,\nso this is the no-arbitrage forward price. Any other forward price will create an arbitrage\nopportunity at the initiation of the forward contract.\nIn a case where there are only benefits of holding the asset over the life of the forward\ncontract, the cost of buying the asset and holding it until the expiration of the forward\nat time Tis [S, \u2013 PV, (benefit) (1 + Rf)T. Again, any forward price that is not the\nno-arbitrage forward price will create an arbitrage opportunity. Note the no-arbitrage\nforward price is lower the greater the present value of the benefits and higher the greater\nthe present value of the costs incurred over the life of the forward contract.\nIf an asset has both storage costs and benefits from holding the asset over the life of\nthe forward contract, we can combine these in to a more general formula and express\nthe no-arbitrage forward price (that will produce a value of zero for the forward at\ninitiation) as:\n"}
