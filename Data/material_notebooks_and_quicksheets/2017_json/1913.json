{"id": "1913", "text": "Profitability. As compared to FIFO, LIFO produces higher COGS in the income\nstatement and results in lower earnings. Any profitability measure that includes COGS\nwill be higher under FIFO. For example, reducing COGS will result in higher gross,\noperating, and net profit margins as compared to LIFO.\nLiquidity. Compared to FIFO, LIFO results in a lower inventory value on the balance\nsheet. Because inventory (a current asset) is higher under FIFO, the current ratio, a\npopular measure of liquidity, is also higher under FIFO. Working capital is higher under\nFIFO as well, because current assets are higher. The quick ratio is unaffected by the\nfirm's inventory cost flow method because inventory is excluded from its numerator.\n"}
