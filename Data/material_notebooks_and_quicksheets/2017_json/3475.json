{"id": 3475, "text": "An index-linked bond has coupon payments and/or a principal value that is based on a\ncommodity index, an equity index, or some other published index number. Inflationlinked bonds (also called linkers) are the most common type of index-linked bonds.\nTheir payments are based on the change in an inflation index, such as the Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI) in the United States. Indexed bonds that will not pay less than their\noriginal par value at maturity, even when the index has decreased, are termed principal\nprotected bonds.\n"}
