{"id": 1076, "text": "Some countries, especially developing countries, use exchange rate targeting. That is,\nthey target a foreign exchange rate between their currency and another (often the U.S.\ndollar), rather than targeting inflation. As an example, consider a country that has\ntargeted an exchange rate for its currency versus the U.S. dollar. If the foreign exchange\nvalue of the domestic currency falls relative to the U.S. dollar, the monetary authority\nmust use foreign reserves to purchase their domestic currency (which will reduce money\nsupply growth and increase interest rates) in order to reach the target exchange rate.\nConversely, an increase in the foreign exchange value of the domestic currency above\nthe target rate will require sale of the domestic currency in currency markets to reduce\nits value (increasing the domestic money supply and decreasing interest rates) to move\ntowards the target exchange rate. One result of exchange rate targeting may be greater\nvolatility of the money supply because domestic monetary policy must adapt to the\nnecessity of maintaining a stable foreign exchange rate.\nOver the short term, the targeting country can purchase or sell its currency in the\nforeign exchange markets to influence the exchange rate. There are limits, however, on\nhow much influence currency purchases or sales can have on exchange rates over time.\nFor example, a country may run out of foreign reserves with which to purchase its\ncurrency when the exchange value of its currency is still below the target exchange rate.\n"}
