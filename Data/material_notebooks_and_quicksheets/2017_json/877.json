{"id": "877", "text": "Interest rates are our measure of the time value of money, although risk differences in\nfinancial securities lead to differences in their equilibrium interest rates. Equilibrium\ninterest rates are the required rate of return for a particular investment, in the sense that\nthe market rate of return is the return that investors and savers require to get them to\nwillingly lend their funds. Interest rates are also referred to as discount rates and, in fact,\nthe terms are often used interchangeably. If an individual can borrow funds at an interest\nrate of 10%, then that individual should discount payments to be made in the future\nat that rate in order to get their equivalent value in current dollars or other currency.\nFinally, we can also view interest rates as the opportunity cost of current consumption.\nIf the market rate of interest on 1-year securities is 5%, earning an additional 5%\nis the opportunity forgone when current consumption is chosen rather than saving\n(postponing consumption).\n"}
