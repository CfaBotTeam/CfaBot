{"id": 3306, "text": "Unlike sovereigns, municipalities cannot use monetary policy to service their debt\nand usually must balance their operating budgets. Municipal governments\u2019 ability\nto service their general obligation debt depends ultimately on the local economy\n(i.e., the tax base). Economic factors to assess in evaluating the creditworthiness of GO\nbonds include employment, trends in per capita income and per capita debt, tax base\ndimensions (depth, breadth and stability), demographics, and ability to attract new jobs\n(location, infrastructure). Credit analysts must also observe revenue variability through\neconomic cycles. Relying on highly variable taxes that are subject to economic cycles,\nsuch as capital gains and sales taxes, can signal higher credit risk. Municipalities may\nhave long-term obligations such as underfunded pensions and post-retirement benefits.\nInconsistent reporting requirements for municipalities are also an issue.\n"}
