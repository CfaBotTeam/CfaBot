{"id": "1048", "text": "There are several key roles of central banks:\n1. Sole supplier of currency: Central banks have the sole authority to supply money.\nTraditionally, such money was backed by gold; the central bank stood ready to\nconvert the money into a pre-specified quantity of gold. Later on, the gold backing\nwas removed, and money supplied by the central bank was deemed legal tender by\nlaw. Money not backed by any tangible value is termed fiat money. As long as fiat\nmoney holds its value over time and is acceptable for transactions, it can continue to\nserve as a medium of exchange.\n"}
