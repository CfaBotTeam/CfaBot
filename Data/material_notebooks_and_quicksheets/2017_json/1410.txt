{"id": 1410, "text": "When examining the pricing power of firms in an industry, we would like to be able\nto measure elasticity of demand directly, but that is very difficult. Regulators often use\npercentage of market sales (market share) to measure the degree of monopoly or market\npower of a firm. Often, mergers or acquisitions of companies in the same industry or\nmarket are not permitted by government authorities when they determine the market\nshare of the combined firms will be too high and, therefore, detrimental to the economy.\n"}
