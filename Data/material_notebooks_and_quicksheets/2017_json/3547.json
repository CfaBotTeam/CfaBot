{"id": 3547, "text": "The issuer will only choose to exercise the call option when it is to their advantage to\ndo so. That is, they can reduce their interest expense by calling the bond and issuing\nnew bonds at a lower yield.Bond buyers are disadvantaged by the call provision and\nhave more reinvestment risk because their bonds will only be called (redeemed prior to\nmaturity) when the proceeds can be reinvested only at a lower yield. For this reason, a\ncallable bond must offer a higher yield (sell at a lower price) than an otherwise identical\nnoncallable bond. The difference in price between a callable bond and an otherwise\nidentical noncallable bond is equal to the value of the call option to the issuer.\nThere are three styles of exercise for callable bonds:\n1. American style\u2014the bonds can be called anytime after the first call date.\n2. European style\u2014the bonds can only be called on the call date specified.\n3. Bermuda style\u2014the bonds can be called on specified dates after the first call date,\noften on coupon payment dates.\nNote that these are only style names and are not indicative of where the bonds are\nissued.\n"}
