{"id": "338", "text": "A continuous random variable is one for which the number of possible outcomes is\ninfinite, even if lower and upper bounds exist. The actual amount of daily rainfall\nbetween zero and 100 inches is an example of a continuous random variable because the\nactual amount of rainfall can take on an infinite number of values. Daily rainfall can be\nmeasured in inches, half inches, quarter inches, thousandths of inches, or even smaller\nincrements. Thus, the number of possible daily rainfall amounts between zero and 100\ninches is essentially infinite.\n"}
