{"id": 620, "text": "Nonparametric tests either do not consider a particular population parameter or have\nfew assumptions about the population that is sampled. Nonparametric tests are used\nwhen there is concern about quantities other than the parameters of a distribution or\nwhen the assumptions of parametric tests can't be supported. They are also used when\nthe data are not suitable for parametric tests (e.g., ranked observations).\nSituations where a nonparametric test is called for are the following:\n1. The assumptions about the distribution of the random variable that support a\nparametric test are not met. An example would be a hypothesis test of the mean\nvalue for a variable that comes from a distribution that is not normal and is of small\nsize so that neither the t-test nor the z-test are appropriate.\n"}
