{"id": "481", "text": "* The z-statistic is theoretically acceptable here, but use of the t-statistic is more conservative.\nAll of the preceding analysis depends on the sample we draw from the population\nbeing random. If the sample isn\u2019t random, the central limit theorem doesn't apply, our\nestimates won't have the desirable properties, and we can't form unbiased confidence\nintervals. Surprisingly, creating a random sample is not as easy as one might believe.\nThere are a number of potential mistakes in sampling methods that can bias the results.\n"}
