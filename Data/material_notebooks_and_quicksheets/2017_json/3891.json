{"id": 3891, "text": "A PAC may have an initial collar given as 100 \u2013 300 PSA. This means the PAC will\nmake its scheduled payments to investors unless actual prepayment experience is outside\nthese bounds (i.e., above 300 PSA or below 100 PSA). If the prepayment rate is outside\nof these bounds so payments to a PAC tranche are either sooner or later than promised,\nthe PAC tranche is referred to as a broken PAC.\n"}
