{"id": "3346", "text": "Maintenance margin is the minimum amount of margin that must be maintained in\na futures account. If the margin balance in the account falls below the maintenance\nmargin through daily settlement of gains and losses (from changes in the futures price),\nadditional funds must be deposited to bring the margin balance back up to the initial\nmargin amount. This is different from maintenance margin in an equity account, which\nrequires investors only to bring the margin backup to the maintenance margin amount.\nMargin requirements are set by the clearinghouse.\n"}
