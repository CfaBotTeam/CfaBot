A simple\nprobability distribution is that for the roll of one fair die; there are six possible outcomes\nand each one has a probability of 1/6, so they sum to 1. The probability distribution\nof all the possible returns on the S&P 500 Index for the next year is a more complex\nversion of the same idea.\n"}
