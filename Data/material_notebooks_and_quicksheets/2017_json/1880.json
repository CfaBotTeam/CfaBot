{"id": "1880", "text": "If the cost of inventory remains constant over time, determining the firm's COGS and\nending inventory is simple. To compute COGS, simply multiply the number of units\nsold by the cost per unit. Similarly, to compute ending inventory, multiply the number\nof units remaining by the cost per unit.\nHowever, it is likely that the cost of purchasing or producing inventory will change over\ntime. As a result, firms must select a cost flow method (known as the cost flow assumption\nunder U.S. GAAP and cost flow formula under IFRS) to allocate the inventory cost to the\nincome statement (COGS) and the balance sheet (ending inventory).\n"}
