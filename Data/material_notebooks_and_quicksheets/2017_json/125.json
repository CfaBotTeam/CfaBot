Note that the average price paid per share ($8.93) is less than the\narithmetic average of the share prices, \u00ba\n8+9+10\n-= 9.\n3\nFor values that are not all equal: harmonic mean < geometric mean < arithmetic mean.\nThis mathematical fact is the basis for the claimed benefit of purchasing the same dollar\namount of mutual fund shares each month or each week. Some refer to this practice as\n\u201cdollar cost averaging.\"\n"}
