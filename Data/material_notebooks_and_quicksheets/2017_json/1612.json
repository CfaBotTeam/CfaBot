{"id": "1612", "text": "Liquidity ratios measure the firm's ability to satisfy its short-term obligations as they\ncome due. Liquidity ratios include the current ratio, the quick ratio, and the cash ratio.\ncurrent assets\ncurrent ratio = -\ncurrent liabilities\ncash \u2014 marketable securities + receivables\nquick ratio = ca\ncurrent liabilities\ncash + marketable securities\ncash ratio = ca\ncurrent liabilities\nAlthough all three ratios measure the firm's ability to pay current liabilities, they should\nbe considered collectively. For example, assume Firm A has a higher current ratio but\na lower quick ratio as compared to Firm B. This is the result of higher inventory as\ncompared to Firm B. The quick ratio (also known as the acid-test ratio) is calculated by\nexcluding inventory from current assets. Similar analysis can be performed by comparing\nthe quick ratio and the cash ratio. The cash ratio is calculated by excluding inventory\nand receivables.\n"}
