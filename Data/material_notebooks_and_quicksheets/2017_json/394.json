{"id": "394", "text": "We can use this method to find the continuously compounded rate that will generate a\nparticular holding period return. If we are given a holding period return of 12.5% for\nthe year, the equivalent continuously compounded rate is In 1.125 = 11.778%. Since the\ncalculation is based on 1 plus the holding period return, we can also do the calculation\ndirectly from the price relative. The price relative is just the end-of-period value divided\nby the beginning of period value. The continuously compounded rate of return is:\n"}
