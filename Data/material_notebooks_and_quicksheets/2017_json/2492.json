If you need to work with bid\nand ask prices, just remember that the price you get will be the one that is worse\nfor you.\n\u2022 Securities: If you are buying, you must pay the higher price. If you are selling,\nyou only receive the lower price.\nCurrencies: The bid or ask price you get is the one that gives you less of the\ncurrency you are acquiring. This works regardless of which way the exchange\nrate is quoted.\n"}
