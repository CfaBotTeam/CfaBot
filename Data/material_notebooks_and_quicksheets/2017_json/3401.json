{"id": "3401", "text": "Details of sinking fund provisions vary. There may be a period during which no sinking\nfund redemptions are made. The amount of bonds redeemed according to the sinking\nfund provision could decline each year or increase each year. Some bond indentures\nallow the company to redeem twice the amount required by the sinking fund provision,\nwhich is called a doubling option or an accelerated sinking fund.\nThe price at which bonds are redeemed under a sinking fund provision is typically\npar but can be different from par. If the market price is less than the sinking fund\nredemption price, the issuer can satisfy the sinking fund provision by buying bonds in\nthe open market with a par value equal to the amount of bonds that must be redeemed.\nThis would be the case if interest rates had risen since issuance so that the bonds were\ntrading below the sinking fund redemption price.\n"}
