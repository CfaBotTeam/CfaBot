{"id": "2994", "text": "If a market YTM is not available because the firm's debt is not publicly traded, the\nanalyst may use the rating and maturity of the firm's existing debt to estimate the beforetax cost of debt. If, for example, the firm's debt carries a single-A rating and has an\naverage maturity of 15 years, the analyst can use the yield curve for single-A rated debt\nto determine the current market rate for debt with a 15-year maturity. This approach\nis an example of matrix pricing or valuing a bond based on the yields of comparable\nbonds.\n"}
