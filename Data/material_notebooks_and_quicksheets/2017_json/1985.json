{"id": "1985", "text": "When a firm makes an expenditure, it can either capitalize the cost as an asset on the\nbalance sheet or expense the cost in the income statement in the period incurred. As a\ngeneral rule, an expenditure that is expected to provide a future economic benefit over\nmultiple accounting periods is capitalized; however, if the future economic benefit is\nunlikely or highly uncertain, the expenditure is expensed in the period incurred.\n"}
