{"id": 1320, "text": "We can, however, still identify the conditions under which a firm is breaking even,\nshould shut down in the short run, and should shut down in the long run in terms of\ntotal costs and total revenue. These conditions are:\n\u2022 TR = TC: break even.\n\u2022 TC > TR> TVO: firm should continue to operate in the short run but shut down\nin the long run.\nTR < TVC: firm should shut down in the short run and the long run.\nBecause price does not equal marginal revenue for a firm in imperfect competition,\nanalysis based on total costs and revenues is better suited for examining breakeven and\nshutdown points.\n"}
