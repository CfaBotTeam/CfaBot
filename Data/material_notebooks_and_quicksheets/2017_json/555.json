{"id": 555, "text": "Consider a two-tailed hypothesis test about the mean value of a random variable at the\n95% significance level where the test statistic is 2.3, greater than the upper critical value\nof 1.96. If we consult the Z-table, we find the probability of getting a value greater than\n2.3 is (1 - 0.9893) = 1.07%. Since it's a two-tailed test, our p-value is 2 x 1.07 = 2.14%,\nas illustrated in Figure 5. At a 3%, 4%, or 5% significance level, we would reject the null\nhypothesis, but at a 2% or 1% significance level we would not. Many researchers report\np-values without selecting a significance level and allow the reader to judge how strong\nthe evidence for rejection is.\n"}
