{"id": 2314, "text": "The high risk of our biotech stock, however, is primarily from firm-specific factors, so\nits unsystematic risk is high. Because market factors such as economic growth rates have\nlittle to do with the eventual outcome for this stock, systematic risk is a small proportion\nof the total risk of the stock.

An established\nmanufacturer of machine tools may not be a very risky investment in terms of total risk,\n"}
