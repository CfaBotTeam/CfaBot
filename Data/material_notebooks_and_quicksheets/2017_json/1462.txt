{"id": 1462, "text": "The LM curve (liquidity-money) in Figure 3 illustrates the positive relationship between\nreal interest rates and income consistent with equilibrium in the money market. Higher\nreal interest rates decrease the quantity of real money balances individuals want to hold,\nso for a given real money supply (M/P constant), equilibrium in the money market\nrequires that an increase in real interest rates be accompanied by an increase in income.\nThe increase in the demand for money from an increase in income can offset the\ndecrease in demand for money from higher real interest rates and restore equilibrium in\nthe money market.\n"}
