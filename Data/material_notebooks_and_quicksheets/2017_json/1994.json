{"id": 1994, "text": "Research and development costs. Under IFRS, research costs, which are costs aimed at\nthe discovery of new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, are expensed\nas incurred. However, development costs may be capitalized. Development costs are\nincurred to translate research findings into a plan or design of a new product or process.\nTo recognize an intangible asset in development, a firm must show that it can complete\nthe asset and intends to use or sell the completed asset, among other criteria.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, both research and development costs are generally expensed as\nincurred. However, the costs of creating software for sale to others are treated in\na manner similar to the treatment of research and development costs under IFRS.\nCosts incurred to develop software for sale to others are expensed as incurred until\nthe product's technological feasibility has been established, after which the costs of\ndeveloping a salable product are capitalized.\n"}
