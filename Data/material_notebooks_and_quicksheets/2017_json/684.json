{"id": "684", "text": "Moving averages for different periods can be used together, such as 20-day and 250day averages. Points where the short-term average (more volatile) crosses the long-term\naverage (smoother) can indicate changes in the price trend. When the short-term average\ncrosses above long-term average (a \u201cgolden cross\u201d), this is often viewed as an indicator\nof an emerging uptrend or a \u201cbuy\u201d signal by technical analysts. The short-term average\ncrossing below the long-term average (a \u201cdead cross\u201d) is often viewed as an indicator of\nan emerging downtrend or a \u201csell\u201d signal.\nBollinger bands are constructed based on the standard deviation of closing prices over\nthe last n periods. An analyst can draw high and low bands a chosen number of standard\ndeviations (typically two) above and below the n-period moving average. The bands\nmove away from one another when price volatility increases and move closer together\nwhen prices are less volatile (see Figure 8).\nBollinger bands are viewed as useful for indicating when prices are extreme by recent\nstandards on either the high or low side. Prices at or above the upper Bollinger band\nmay be viewed as indicating an overbought market, one that is \"too high\u201d and likely to\ndecrease in the near term. Likewise, prices at or below the lower Bollinger band may be\nviewed as indicating an oversold market, one that is \u201ctoo low\u201d and likely to increase in\nthe near term. A possible trading strategy using Bollinger bands is to buy when the price\nis at the lower band or sell when the price is at the upper band. This is an example of a\ncontrarian strategy\u2014one that buys when most traders are selling and sells when most\ntraders are buying. Contrarians believe markets get overbought or oversold because most\ninvestors tend to buy and sell at the wrong times, and thus it can be profitable to trade\nin the opposite direction.\n"}
