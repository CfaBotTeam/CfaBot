{"id": 1908, "text": "For example, consider a firm with a LIFO reserve of $150 that faces a tax rate of 40%.\nTo convert the balance sheet to FIFO, increase inventory by $150, decrease cash by $60\n($150 x 40%), and increase stockholders' equity (retained earnings) by $90 [$150 x (1 -\n40%)]. This will bring the accounting equation back into balance. The net effect of the\nadjustments is an increase in assets and shareholders' equity of $90, which is equal to the\nLIFO reserve net of tax.\n"}
