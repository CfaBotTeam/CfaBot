{"id": 2467, "text": "Insurance firms also provide a benefit to investors by managing the risks inherent in\ninsurance: moral hazard, adverse selection, and fraud. Moral hazard occurs because the\ninsured may take more risks once he is protected against losses. Adverse selection occurs\nwhen those most likely to experience losses are the predominant buyers of insurance. In\nfraud, the insured purposely causes damage or claims fictitious losses so he can collect on\nhis insurance policy.\n"}
