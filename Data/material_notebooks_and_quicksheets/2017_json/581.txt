Candidates must\n\u201cIdentify the appropriate test statistic and interpret the results of a hypothesis\ntest....\u201d Certainly you should know that this is a t-test, and that we reject the\nhypothesis of equality when the test statistic is outside the critical t-values. Don't\nworry about memorizing the formulas given below. You should understand,\nhowever, that we can pool the data to get the standard deviation of the difference\nin means when we assume equal variances, while both sample variances are\nused to get the standard error of the difference in means when we assume the\npopulation variances are not equal.\n"}
