{"id": "3004", "text": "The beta of a firm is a function not only of the business risks of its projects (lines of\nbusiness) but also of its financial structure. For a given set of projects, the greater a firm's\nreliance on debt financing, the greater its equity beta. For this reason, we must adjust the\npure-play beta from a comparable company (or group of companies) for the company's\nleverage (unlever it) and then adjust it (re-lever it) based on the financial structure of the\ncompany evaluating the project. We can then use this equity beta to calculate the cost of\nequity to be used in evaluating the project.\n"}
