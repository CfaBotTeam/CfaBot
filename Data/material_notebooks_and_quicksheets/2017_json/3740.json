{"id": "3740", "text": "Relationship between Price and Maturity\nPrior to maturity, a bond can be selling at a significant discount or premium to par\nvalue. However, regardless of its required yield, the price will converge to par value as\nmaturity approaches. Consider a bond with $1,000 par value and a 3-year life paying\n6% semiannual coupons. The bond values corresponding to required yields of 3%, 6%,\nand 12% as the bond approaches maturity are presented in Figure 2.\n"}
