{"id": 1598, "text": "The par value of common stock is a stated or legal value. Par value has no relationship\nto fair value. Some common shares are even issued without a par value. When par value\nexists, it is reported separately in stockholders' equity.\nAlso disclosed is the number of common shares that are authorized, issued, and\noutstanding. Authorized shares are the number of shares that may be sold under the\nfirm's articles of incorporation. Issued shares are the number of shares that have actually\nbeen sold to shareholders. The number of outstanding shares is equal to the issued\nshares less shares that have been reacquired by the firm (i.e., treasury stock).\nPreferred stock has certain rights and privileges not conferred by common stock.\nFor example, preferred shareholders are paid dividends at a specified rate, usually\nexpressed as a percentage of par value, and have priority over the claims of the common\nshareholders in the event of liquidation.\nPreferred stock can be classified as debt or equity, depending on the terms. For example,\nperpetual preferred stock that is non-redeemable is considered equity. However,\npreferred stock that calls for mandatory redemption in fixed amounts is considered a\nfinancial liability.\n"}
