{"id": 328, "text": "C. You can answer this question any number of different ways, but here is the most\nobvious:\nEvent 1: The realized return is greater than the expected return.\nEvent 2: The realized return is equal to the expected return.\nEvent 3: The realized return is less than the expected return.\nD. With six assets in the portfolio, there will be 6 variance terms and 15 unique\ncovariance terms. The covariance matrix will have 6 x 6 = 36 cells. The covariance of\na stock return with itself is its variance; those will be the six entries on the diagonal.\nThe other 30 cells are the covariance pairs, but since each pair appears twice in the\nmatrix\u2014Cov(A,B) is the same as Cov(B,A)\u2014the number of unique covariance pairs\nis half of that, or 15. For any portfolio of n assets, the portfolio variance calculation\nwould involve n variance terms and n(n - 1) / 2 unique covariance terms.\nThe prior probability that the builder will increase its orders is 25%.\nP(increase) = 0.25\nP(no increase) = 0.75\n"}
