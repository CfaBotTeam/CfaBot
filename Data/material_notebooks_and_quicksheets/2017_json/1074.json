{"id": "1074", "text": "Central banks have used various economic variables and indicators over the years to\nmake monetary policy decisions. In the past, some have used interest rate targeting,\nincreasing the money supply when specific interest rates rose above the target band and\ndecreasing the money supply (or the rate of money supply growth) when rates fell below\nthe target band. Currently, inflation targeting is the most widely used tool for making\nmonetary policy decisions and is, in fact, the method required by law in some countries.\nCentral banks that currently use inflation targeting include the U.K., Brazil, Canada,\nAustralia, Mexico, and the European Central Bank.\n"}
