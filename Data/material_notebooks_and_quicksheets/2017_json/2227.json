{"id": 2227, "text": "In the previous example, the cash flows in and out of the account occur at 1-year\nintervals so that we solved for an annual money-weighted rate of return. More generally,\nwe must use the shortest period between significant cash flows into or out of the account\nwhen setting up the internal rate of return calculation. For example, if we use one\nmonth as our period (zero cash flow for months with no cash flows), the internal rate\nof return calculation will yield a monthly rate of return. In that case, we would need to\ncompound the monthly money-weighted return for 12 months to translate it into an\neffective annual rate.\n"}
