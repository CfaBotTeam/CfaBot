{"id": 225, "text": "Example: Joint probability for more than two independent events (2)\nUsing empirical probabilities, suppose we observe that the DJIA has closed higher on\ntwo-thirds of all days in the past few decades. Furthermore, it has been determined\nthat up and down days are independent. Based on this information, compute the\nprobability of the DJIA closing higher for five consecutive days.\nAnswer:\nP(DJIA up five days in a row) = 2/3 x 2/3 x 2/3 x 2/3 x 2/3 = (2/3)5 = 0.132\nSimilarly:\n"}
