{"id": 516, "text": "A hypothesis is a statement about the value of a population parameter developed for the\npurpose of testing a theory or belief. Hypotheses are stated in terms of the population\nparameter to be tested, like the population mean, pl. For example, a researcher may be\ninterested in the mean daily return on stock options. Hence, the hypothesis may be that\nthe mean daily return on a portfolio of stock options is positive.\nHypothesis testing procedures, based on sample statistics and probability theory, are\nused to determine whether a hypothesis is a reasonable statement and should not be\nrejected or if it is an unreasonable statement and should be rejected. The process of\nhypothesis testing consists of a series of steps shown in Figure 1.\n"}
