{"id": 3165, "text": "We say mortgage-backed bonds have a prepayment option, which is similar to a call\noption on a corporate bond. The borrowers (people who take out mortgages) typically\nhave the option to pay off the principal value of their loans, in whole or in part, at\nany time. These prepayments accelerate when interest rates fall significantly because\nborrowers can refinance their home loans at a lower rate and pay off the remaining\nprincipal owed on an existing loan.\n"}
