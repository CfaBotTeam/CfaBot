{"id": 233, "text": "Example: An investment application of unconditional probability\nBuilding upon our ongoing example about interest rates and economic recession, we\ncan assume that a recession can only occur with either of the two events\u2014interest\nrates increase (I) or interest rates do not increase (19)\u2014since these events are mutually\nexclusive and exhaustive. I\u00ba is read \u201cthe complement of I,\u201d which means \u201cnot I.\"\nTherefore, the probability of IC is 1 - P(I). It is logical, therefore, that the sum of the\ntwo joint probabilities must be the unconditional probability of a recession. This can\nbe expressed as follows:\n"}
