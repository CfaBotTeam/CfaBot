{"id": "27", "text": "The net present value (NPV) of an investment project is the present value of expected\ncash inflows associated with the project less the present value of the project's expected\ncash outflows, discounted at the appropriate cost of capital. The following procedure\nmay be used to compute NPV:\n\u2022 Identify all costs (outflows) and benefits (inflows) associated with an investment.\nDetermine the appropriate discount rate or opportunity cost for the investment.\nUsing the appropriate discount rate, find the PV of each cash flow. Inflows are\npositive and increase NPV. Outflows are negative and decrease NPV.\nCompute the NPV, the sum of the DCFs.\nMathematically, NPV is expressed as:\n"}
