{"id": 2476, "text": "Issues of corporate governance and conflicts of interest arise when company management\nproposes and the board passes anti-takeover measures to protect their jobs. Staggered\nboard elections make a hostile takeover more costly and difficult.\nAn important non-market factor that can affect stakeholder relationships is the legal\nenvironment within which the company operates. Shareholders' and creditors' interests\nare considered to be better protected in countries with a common-law system under\nwhich judges' rulings become law in some instances. In a civil law system, judges are\nbound to rule based only on specifically enacted laws. In general, the rights of creditors\nare more clearly defined than those of shareholders and, therefore, are not as difficult to\nenforce through the courts.\n"}
