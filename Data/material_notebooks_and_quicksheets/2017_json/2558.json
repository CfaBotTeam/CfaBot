{"id": "2558", "text": "Index providers must make several decisions:\nWhat is the target market the index is intended to measure?\nWhich securities from the target market should be included?\nHow should the securities be weighted in the index?\nHow often should the index be rebalanced?\nWhen should the selection and weighting of securities be re-examined?\nThe target market may be defined very broadly (e.g., stocks in the United States) or\nnarrowly (e.g., small-cap value stocks in the United States). It may also be defined by\ngeographic region or by economic sector (e.g., cyclical stocks). The constituent stocks\nin the index could be all the stocks in that market or just a representative sample. The\nselection process may be determined by an objective rule or subjectively by a committee.\n"}
