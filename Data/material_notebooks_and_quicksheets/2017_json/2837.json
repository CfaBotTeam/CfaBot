{"id": "2837", "text": "In practice, other things are not equal. An increase in the dividend payout ratio, for\nexample, will reduce the firm's sustainable growth rate. While higher dividends will\nincrease firm value, a lower growth rate will decrease firm value. This relationship is\nreferred to as the dividend displacement of earnings. The net effect on firm value of\nincreasing the dividend payout ratio is ambiguous. As intuition would suggest, firms\ncannot continually increase their P/Es or market values by increasing the dividend\npayout ratio. Otherwise, all firms would have 100% payout ratios.\n"}
