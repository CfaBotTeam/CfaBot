{"id": "3625", "text": "14. A bond that is trading at $1,058 and makes annual coupon payments that sum to\n$50 has a current yield of 50 / 1,058 = 4.726%.\nThe yield to maturity (YTM) of a bond, on an annual basis, is the effective annual\nyield and is used for bonds that pay an annual coupon. For bonds that pay coupons\nsemiannually, we often quote the YTM on a semiannual basis, that is, two times the\neffective semiannual yield. To compare the yields of two bonds, we must calculate their\nYTMs on the same basis.\n"}
