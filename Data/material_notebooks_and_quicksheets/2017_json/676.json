This refers to a\nbelief that breached resistance levels become support levels and that breached support\nlevels become resistance levels. In Figure 5, the area of 55 is viewed as as resistance level\nuntil the price breaks above that level, then 55 becomes a support level as prices decline\nfrom their new highs.\n"}
