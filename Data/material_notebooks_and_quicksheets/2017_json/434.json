The main advantages of historical simulation are that it uses actual historical values for\nthe model inputs so that the analyst does not need to make assumptions about their\nprobability distributions, and it is a less computer-intensive procedure. A disadvantage\nof historical simulation is that it assumes the past behavior of the variables is a reliable\nindicator of their future behavior, which might not be the case. Historical simulation\nalso lacks the Monte Carlo approach's ability to model \u201cwhat if\u201d questions by changing\nthe assumed probability distributions of the model inputs.\n"}
