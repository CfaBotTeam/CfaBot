{"id": "1042", "text": "3. Speculative demand: Money that is available to take advantage of investment\nopportunities that arise in the future. It is inversely related to returns available in the\nmarket. As bonds and other financial instruments provide higher returns, investors\nwould rather invest their money now than hold speculative money balances.\nConversely, the demand for money for speculative reasons is positively related to\nperceived risk in other financial instruments. If the risk is perceived to be higher,\npeople choose to hold money rather than invest it.\nThe relation between short-term interest rates and the quantity of money that firms and\nhouseholds demand to hold is illustrated in Figure 1. At lower interest rates, firms and\nhouseholds choose to hold more money. At higher interest rates, the opportunity cost of\nholding money increases, and firms and households will desire to hold less money and\nmore interest-bearing financial assets.\n"}
