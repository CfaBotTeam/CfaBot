{"id": "624", "text": "A Type I error is the rejection of the null hypothesis when it is actually true, while a\nType II error is the failure to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.\nThe significance level can be interpreted as the probability that a test statistic will reject\nthe null hypothesis by chance when it is actually true (i.e., the probability of a Type I\nerror). A significance level must be specified to select the critical values for the test.\nLOS 12.d\nHypothesis testing compares a computed test statistic to a critical value at a stated level\nof significance, which is the decision rule for the test.\n"}
