{"id": "134", "text": "As you have just seen, a major problem with using the variance is the difficulty of\ninterpreting it. The computed variance, unlike the mean, is in terms of squared units of\nmeasurement. How does one interpret squared percents, squared dollars, or squared yen?\nThis problem is mitigated through the use of the standard deviation. The population\nstandard deviation, o, is the square root of the population variance and is calculated as\nfollows:\n|N\nZ(x-p)2\nV N\n"}
