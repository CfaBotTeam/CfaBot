{"id": 3902, "text": "There are several means of creating loan-level call protection:\nPrepayment lockout. For a specific period of time (typically two to five years), the\nborrower is prohibited from prepaying the mortgage loan.\nDefeasance. Should the borrower insist on making principal payments on the\nmortgage loan, the mortgage loan can be defeased. This is accomplished by using the\nprepaid principal to purchase a portfolio of government securities that is sufficient to\nmake the remaining required payments on the CMBS. Given the high credit quality\nof government securities, defeased loans increase the credit quality of a CMBS loan\npool.\nPrepayment penalty points. A penalty fee expressed in points may be charged to\nborrowers who prepay mortgage principal. Each point is 1% of the principal amount\nprepaid.\nYield maintenance charges. The borrower is charged the amount of interest lost by\nthe lender should the loan be prepaid. This make whole charge is designed to make\nlenders indifferent to prepayment, as cash flows are equivalent (at current market\nrates) whether the loan is prepaid or not.\nWith all loan call protection programs, any prepayment penalties received are distributed\nto the CMBS investors in a manner determined by the structure of the CMBS issue.\n"}
