{"id": "3409", "text": "When a forward contract is created with a contract rate that gives it a non-zero value\nat initiation, it is called an off-market forward. The forward contracts we found to be\nequivalent to the series of swap payments are almost certainly all off-market forwards\nwith non-zero values at the initiation of the swap. Because the swap itself has zero value\nto both parties at initiation, it must consist of some off-market forwards with positive\npresent values and some off-market forwards with negative present values, so that the\nsum of their present values equals zero.\n"}
