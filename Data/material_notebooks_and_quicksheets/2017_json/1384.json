In this\nmodel, there is a single firm that has a significantly large market share because of its\ngreater scale and lower cost structure\u2014the dominant firm (DF). In such a model, the\nmarket price is essentially determined by the dominant firm, and the other competitive\nfirms (CF) take this market price as given.\n"}
