{"id": 3136, "text": "The intuition is straightforward. If the bond is selling at a discount, the YTM is\ngreater than the coupon rate because together, the amortization of the discount and the\nhigher assumed reinvestment rate on coupon income increase the bond's return. For a\nbond purchased at a premium, the YTM is less than the coupon rate because both the\namortization of the premium and the reduction in interest earned on reinvestment of its\ncash flows decrease the bond's return.\n"}
