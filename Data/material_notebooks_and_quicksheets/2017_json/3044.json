A WACC = (w) (kg) (1 - t) + (w (k) = (0.4)(7.2) + (0.6)(16) = 12.48%\n11. A An increase in the corporate tax rate will reduce the after-tax cost of debt, causing the\nWACC to fall. More specifically, because the after-tax cost of debt = (kg)(1 - t), the term\n(1 - t) decreases, decreasing the after-tax cost of debt. If the risk-free rate were to\nincrease, the costs of debt and equity would both increase, thus causing the firm's cost of\ncapital to increase.\n12. B WACC = (wa) (kg)(1 - t) + (wps (k + (w.
