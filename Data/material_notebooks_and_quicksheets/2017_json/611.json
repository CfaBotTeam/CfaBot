{"id": 611, "text": "Testing the Equality of the Variances of Two Normally Distributed\nPopulations, Based on Two Independent Random Samples\nThe hypotheses concerned with the equality of the variances of two populations are\ntested with an F-distributed test statistic. Hypothesis testing using a test statistic that\nfollows an F-distribution is referred to as the F-test. The F-test is used under the\nassumption that the populations from which samples are drawn are normally distributed\nand that the samples are independent.\n"}
