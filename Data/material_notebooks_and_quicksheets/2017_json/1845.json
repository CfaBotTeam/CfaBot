{"id": "1845", "text": "Three methods of examining the variability of financial outcomes around point estimates\nare: sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and simulation. Sensitivity analysis is based\non \u201cwhat if\u201d questions such as: What will be the effect on net income if sales increase\nby 3% rather than the estimated 5%? Scenario analysis is based on specific scenarios\n(a specific set of outcomes for key variables) and will also yield a range of values for\nfinancial statement items. Simulation is a technique in which probability distributions\nfor key variables are selected and a computer is used to generate a distribution of values\nfor outcomes based on repeated random selection of values for the key variables.\n"}
