The primary benefit of securitization is to decrease the\nfunding costs for the assets in the pool. A firm may set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV)\nor special purpose entity (SPE) to buy firm assets, which removes them from the firm's\nbalance sheet and may increase their value by removing the risk that financial trouble at\nthe firm will give other investors a claim to the assets cash flows.\n"}
