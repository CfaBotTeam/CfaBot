{"id": "3151", "text": "Previously, we showed that for a bond held to maturity, the investor's rate of return\nincreased with an increase in the bond's YTM and decreased with a decrease in the\nbond's YTM. For an investor who intends to hold a bond to maturity, there is no\ninterest rate risk as we have defined it. Assuming no default, the bond's value at\nmaturity is its par value regardless of interest rate changes so that the investor has only\nreinvestment risk. Her realized return will increase when interest earned on reinvested\ncash flows increases, and decrease when the reinvestment rate decreases.\n"}
