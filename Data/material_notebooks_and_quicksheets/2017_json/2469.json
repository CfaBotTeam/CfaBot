{"id": 2469, "text": "In markets with good information, pure arbitrage is rare because traders will favor\nthe markets with the best prices. More commonly, arbitrageurs try to exploit pricing\ndifferences for similar instruments. For example, a dealer who sells a call option will\noften also buy the stock because the call and stock price are highly correlated. Likewise,\narbitrageurs will attempt to exploit discrepancies in the pricing of the call and stock.\nMany (risk) arbitrageurs use complex models for valuation of related securities and for\nrisk control. Creating similar positions using different assets is referred to as replication.\nThis is also a form of intermediation because similar risks are traded in different forms\nand in different markets.\n"}
