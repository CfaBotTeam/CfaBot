{"id": 1958, "text": "Analysis of Viper's ratios relative to a group of industry peers\nLiquidity: The after-tax LIFO adjustment resulted in an increase in Viper's current ratio.\nThe adjusted ratio exceeds the peer group, indicating greater liquidity. Because inventory\nis the largest component of Viper's current assets, additional analysis is needed.\nActivity: Viper's adjusted inventory turnover declined as expected due to the decrease in\nCOGS and the increase in average inventory. Adjusted inventory turnover is less than\nthe peer group, which indicates that it takes Viper longer to sell its goods. In terms of\ninventory days (365 / inventory turnover), Viper has 48.0 days of inventory on hand\nwhile the peer group has 37.2 days on hand. Too much inventory is costly and can also\nbe an indication of obsolescence.\n"}
