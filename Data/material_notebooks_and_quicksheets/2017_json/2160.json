{"id": 2160, "text": "ETFs can be sold short, purchased on margin, and traded at intraday prices, whereas\nopen-end funds are typically sold and redeemed only daily, based on the share NAV\ncalculated with closing asset prices. Investors in ETFs must pay brokerage commissions\nwhen they trade, and there is a spread between the bid price at which market makers\nwill buy shares and the ask price at which market makers will sell shares. With most\nETFs, investors receive any dividend income on portfolio stocks in cash, while openend funds offer the alternative of reinvesting dividends in additional fund shares. One\nfinal difference is that ETFs may produce less capital gains liability compared to openend index funds. This is because investor sales of ETF shares do not require the fund to\nsell any securities. If an open-end fund has significant redemptions that cause it to sell\nappreciated portfolio shares, shareholders incur a capital gains tax liability.\nA separately managed account is a portfolio that is owned by a single investor and\nmanaged according to that investor's needs and preferences. No shares are issued, as the\nsingle investor owns the entire account.\nHedge funds are pools of investor funds that are not regulated to the extent that\nmutual funds are. Hedge funds are limited in the number of investors who can invest\nin the fund and are often sold only to qualified investors who have a minimum amount\nof overall portfolio wealth. Minimum investments can be quite high, often between\n$250,000 and $1 million.\n"}
