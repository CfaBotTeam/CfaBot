{"id": 3271, "text": "Coverage Ratios\nCoverage ratios measure the borrower's ability to generate cash flows to meet interest\npayments. The two most commonly used are EBITDA-to-interest and EBIT-to-interest.\n1. EBITDA/interest expense. A higher ratio indicates lower credit risk. This ratio is\nused more often than the EBIT-to-interest expense ratio. Because depreciation and\namortization are still included as part of the cash flow measure, this ratio will be\nhigher than the EBIT version.\n"}
