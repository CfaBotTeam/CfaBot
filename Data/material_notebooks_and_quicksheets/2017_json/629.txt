Degrees of freedom are n-1.\nThe test comparing two variances based on independent samples from two\nnormally distributed populations uses an F-distributed test statistic: F= }, where si is\nthe variance of the first sample and s\u1eaf is the (smaller) variance of the second sample.\nLOS 12.k\nParametric tests, like the t-test, F-test, and chi-square tests, make assumptions regarding\nthe distribution of the population from which samples are drawn. Nonparametric\ntests either do not consider a particular population parameter or have few assumptions\nabout the sampled population. Nonparametric tests are used when the assumptions of\nparametric tests can't be supported or when the data are not suitable for parametric tests.\n"}
