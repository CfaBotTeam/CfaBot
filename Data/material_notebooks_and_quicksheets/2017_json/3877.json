{"id": 3877, "text": "Institutional investors have different tolerances for prepayment risk. Some are primarily\nconcerned with extension risk while others may want to minimize exposure to\ncontraction risk. By partitioning and distributing the cash flows generated by RMBS\ninto different risk packages to better match investor preferences, CMOs increase the\npotential market for securitized mortgages and perhaps reduce funding costs as a result.\nCMOs are securities backed by mortgage pass-through securities (i.e., they are securities\nsecured by other securities). Interest and principal payments from the mortgage passthrough securities are allocated in a specific way to different bond classes called tranches,\nso that each tranche has a different claim against the cash flows of the mortgage passthroughs. Each CMO tranche has a different mixture of contraction and extension risk.\nHence, CMO securities can be more closely matched to the unique asset/liability needs\nof institutional investors and investment managers.\n"}
