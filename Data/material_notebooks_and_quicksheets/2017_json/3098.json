{"id": 3098, "text": "Some firms use stock splits and stock dividends to keep stock prices within a perceived\noptimal trading range of $20 to $80 per share. What does academic research have to say\nabout this?\n\u2022 Stock prices tend to rise after a split or stock dividend.\nPrice increases appear to occur because stock splits are taken as a positive signal from\nmanagement about future earnings.\nIf a report of good earnings does not follow a stock split, prices tend to revert to\ntheir original (split-adjusted) levels.\nStock splits and dividends tend to reduce liquidity due to higher percentage\nbrokerage fees on lower-priced stocks.\nThe conclusion is that stock splits and stock dividends create more shares but don't\nincrease shareholder value.\n"}
