{"id": 2200, "text": "One way to avoid a risk is to not engage in the activity with the uncertain outcome. If\npolitical risks in a country are to be avoided, simply not investing in securities of firms\nbased in that country or not expanding a business enterprise to that country would avoid\nthose risks. A decision to avoid certain risks typically would come from top management\nas a part of establishing the risk tolerance of the organization and would be instituted\nbecause the risks are judged to outweigh the potential benefits of specific activities.\nSome risks can be prevented. The risk of a data breach can be prevented with a greater\nlevel of security for the data and stronger processes. In this case, the benefits of reducing\nor eliminating the risk are judged to be greater than the cost of doing so.\nFor risks that management has decided to bear, the organization will seek to bear them\nefficiently. Diversification may offer a way to more efficiently bear a specific risk.\n"}
