{"id": "1059", "text": "Monetary policy is implemented using the monetary policy tools of the central bank.\nThe three main policy tools of central banks are as follows:\n1. Policy rate: In the United States, banks can borrow funds from the Fed if they have\ntemporary shortfalls in reserves. The rate at which banks can borrow reserves from\nthe Fed is termed the discount rate. For the European Central Bank (ECB), it is\ncalled the refinancing rate.\nOne way to lend money to banks is through a repurchase agreement. The central\nbank purchases securities from banks that, in turn, agree to repurchase the securities\nat a higher price in the future. The percentage difference between the purchase price\nand the repurchase price is effectively the rate at which the central bank is lending\nto member banks. The Bank of England uses this method, and its policy rate is\ncalled the two-week repo (repurchase) rate. A lower rate reduces banks' cost of funds,\nencourages lending, and tends to decrease interest rates overall. A higher policy rate\nhas the opposite effect, decreasing lending and increasing interest rates.\n"}
