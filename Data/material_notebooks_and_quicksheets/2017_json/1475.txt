{"id": 1475, "text": "Shifts in the Aggregate Demand Curve\nThe aggregate demand (AD) curve reflects the total level of expenditures in an economy\nby consumers, businesses, governments, and foreigners. A number of factors can affect\nthis level of expenditures and cause the AD curve to shift. Note that a change in the\nprice level is represented as a movement along the AD curve, not a shift in the AD curve.\nIn Figure 8, an increase in aggregate demand is shown by a shift to the right, indicating\nthat the quantity of goods and services demanded is greater at any given price level.\n"}
