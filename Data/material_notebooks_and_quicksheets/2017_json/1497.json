{"id": "1497", "text": "A second case to consider is an increase in aggregate demand that results in an\nequilibrium at a level of GDP greater than full-employment GDP in the short run,\nas illustrated in Figure 12. Note that both GDP and the price level are increased. The\neconomy can operate at a level of GDP greater than full-employment GDP in the short\nrun, as workers work overtime and maintenance of productive equipment is delayed, but\noutput greater than full-employment GDP cannot be maintained in the long run. In the\nlong run, the economy always returns to full-employment GDP along the LRAS curve.\n"}
