{"id": "385", "text": "The reasoning behind the safety-first criterion is illustrated in Figure 8. Assume an\ninvestor is choosing between two portfolios: Portfolio A with expected return of 12%\nand standard deviation of returns of 18%, and Portfolio B with expected return of 10%\nand standard deviation of returns of 12%. The investor has stated that he wants to\nminimize the probability of losing money (negative returns). Assuming that returns are\nnormally distributed, the portfolio with the larger SFR using 0% as the threshold return\n(R) will be the one with the lower probability of negative returns.\n"}
