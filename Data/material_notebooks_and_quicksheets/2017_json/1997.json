{"id": "1997", "text": "Intangible Assets Obtained in a Business Combination\nThe acquisition method is used to account for business combinations. Under the\nacquisition method, the purchase price is allocated to the identifiable assets and\nliabilities of the acquired firm on the basis of fair value. Any remaining amount of the\npurchase price is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is said to be an unidentifiable asset that\ncannot be separated from the business itself.\nOnly goodwill created in a business combination is capitalized on the balance sheet. The\ncosts of any internally generated \u201cgoodwill\" are expensed in the period incurred.\n"}
