{"id": "2355", "text": "Two measures of risk-adjusted returns based on systematic risk (beta) rather than total\nrisk are the Treynor measure and Jensen's alpha. They are similar to the Sharpe ratio\nand M\u00ba in that the Treynor measure is based on slope and Jensen's alpha is a measure of\npercentage returns in excess of those from a portfolio that has the same beta but lies on\nthe SML.\nThe Treynor measure is calculated as KP Kf, interpreted as excess returns per\nlas Rp \u2013 Rf, interpre\nBp\nunit of systematic risk, and represented by the slope of a line as illustrated in Figure 12.\nJensen's alpha for Portfolio P is calculated as ap= R, - [R+ B(Rm - R)] and is the\npercentage portfolio return above that of a portfoli\u00f3 (or security) with the same beta as\nthe portfolio that lies on the SML, as illustrated in Figure 12.\n"}
