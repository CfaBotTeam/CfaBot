{"id": "2580", "text": "Sector index. Measures the returns for an industry sector such as health care,\nfinancial, or consumer goods firms. Investors can use these indexes in cyclical\nanalysis because some sectors do better than others in various phases of the business\ncycle. Sector indexes can be for a particular country or global. These indexes are used\nto evaluate portfolio managers and to construct index portfolios.\nStyle index. Measures the returns to market capitalization and value or growth\nstrategies. Some indexes reflect a combination of the two (e.g., small-cap value\nfund). Because there is no widely accepted definition of large-cap, mid-cap, or\nsmall-cap stocks, different indexes use different definitions. These definitions may\nbe specified values of market capitalization or relative definitions, such as defining\nlarge-cap stocks as the largest 500 firms in a given market. In constructing value\nstock and growth stock indexes, price-to-earnings ratios or dividend yields are often\nused to identify value and growth stocks. Over time, stocks can migrate from one\nclassification to another. For example, a successful small-cap company might grow to\nbecome a mid-cap or large-cap company. This causes style indexes to typically have\nhigher turnover of constituent firms than broad market indexes.\n"}
