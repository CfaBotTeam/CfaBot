{"id": "77", "text": "The time-weighted rate of return measures compound growth. It is the rate at which $1\ncompounds over a specified performance horizon.\nIf funds are added to a portfolio just before a period of poor performance, the moneyweighted return will be lower than the time-weighted return. If funds are added just\nprior to a period of high returns, the money-weighted return will be higher than the\ntime-weighted return.\nThe time-weighted return is the preferred measure of a manager's ability to select\ninvestments. If the manager controls the money flows into and out of an account, the\nmoney-weighted return is the more appropriate performance measure.\n"}
