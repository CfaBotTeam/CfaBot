{"id": 1671, "text": "A change in accounts payable indicates a difference between purchases and the amount\npaid to suppliers. An increase in accounts payable, for example, results when purchases\nare greater than cash paid to suppliers. Since purchases were subtracted in calculating\nnet income, we need to add any increase in accounts payable to net income so that CFO\nreflects the actual cash disbursements for purchases (rather than total purchases).\n"}
