{"id": "3766", "text": "Bond yields calculated using the stated coupon payment dates are referred to as\nfollowing the street convention. Because some coupon dates will fall on weekends\nand holidays, coupon payments will actually be made the next business day. The yield\ncalculated using these actual coupon payment dates is referred to as the true yield.\nSome coupon payments will be made later when holidays and weekends are taken into\naccount, so true yields will be slightly lower than street convention yields, if only by a\nfew basis points.\n"}
