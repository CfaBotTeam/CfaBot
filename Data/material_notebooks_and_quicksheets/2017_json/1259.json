{"id": 1259, "text": "The intuition is that a trade deficit (X - M < 0) means that the right-hand side must\nalso be negative so that the total savings (private savings + government savings) is less\nthan domestic investment in physical capital. The additional amount to fund domestic\ninvestment must come from foreigners, so there is a surplus in the capital account to\noffset the deficit in the trade account. Another thing we can see from this identity is\nthat any government deficit not funded by an excess of domestic saving over domestic\ninvestment is consistent with a trade deficit (imports > exports) which is offset by an\ninflow of foreign capital (a surplus in the capital account).\n"}
