{"id": 2394, "text": "Liquidity: Liquidity refers to the ability to turn investment assets into spendable cash\nin a short period of time without having to make significant price concessions to do so.\nInvestor needs for money to pay tuition, to pay for a parent's assisted living expenses,\nor to fund other possible spending needs may all require that some liquid assets be\nheld. As we noted in an earlier topic review discussing property and casualty insurance\ncompanies, claims arrive unpredictably to some extent and therefore their portfolios\nmust hold a significant proportion of liquid (or maturing) securities in order to be\nprepared to honor these claims. Illiquid investments in hedge funds and private equity\nfunds, which typically are not traded and have restrictions on redemptions, are not\nsuitable for an investor who may unexpectedly need access to the funds.\n"}
