{"id": "1289", "text": "For economic analysis, we often consider only two inputs, capital and labor. The\nquantity of output that a firm can produce can be thought of as a function of the\namounts of capital and labor employed. Such a function is called a production function.\nIf we consider a given amount of capital (a firm's plant and equipment), we can examine\nthe increase in production (increase in total product) that will result as we increase\nthe amount of labor employed. The output with only one worker is considered the\nmarginal product of the first unit of labor. The addition of a second worker will increase\ntotal product by the marginal product of the second worker. The marginal product of\n(additional output from) the second worker is likely greater than the marginal product\nof the first. This is true if we assume that two workers can produce more than twice as\nmuch output as one because of the benefits of teamwork or specialization of tasks. At\nthis low range of labor input (remember, we are holding capital constant), we can say\nthat the marginal product of labor is increasing.\n"}
