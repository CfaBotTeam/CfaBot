{"id": "690", "text": "Margin debt. The amount of margin debt is a readily available indicator because\nbrokers are required to report this data. Increases in total margin debt outstanding\nsuggest aggressive buying by bullish margin investors. As margin investors reach\ntheir limits of margin credit, their ability to continue buying decreases, which\ncan cause prices to begin declining. As prices decrease, investors may need to sell\nsecurities to meet margin calls, and these sales drive prices lower still. Increasing\nmargin debt tends to coincide with increasing market prices and decreasing margin\ndebt tends to coincide with decreasing prices.\nShort interest ratio. Just as an increase in margin debt suggests aggressive buying\nand strong positive sentiment, increases in shares sold short indicate strong negative\nsentiment. Short interest is the number of shares investors have borrowed and sold\nshort. As with margin debt, short interest must be reported by brokerage firms. The\nshort interest ratio is short interest divided by average daily trading volume. While\na high short interest ratio means investors expect the stock price to decrease, it also\nimplies future buying demand when short sellers must return their borrowed shares.\nThus, technical analysts' opinions are divided as to how the short interest ratio\nshould be interpreted.\nSince technical analysis is based on changes in supply and demand conditions, indicators\nof the flow of funds in the financial markets can be useful for observing changes in the\nsupply of securities and the demand for them.\n\u2022 The Arms index or short-term trading index (TRIN) is a measure of funds flowing\ninto advancing and declining stocks. The index is calculated as:\nNumber of advancing issues/\n/Number of declining issues\nTRIN =\nVolume of advancing issues/\n/Volume of declining issues\n"}
