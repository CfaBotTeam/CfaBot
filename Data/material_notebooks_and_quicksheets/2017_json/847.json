Firms based in any country may present GIPS compliant\nperformance histories.\nA firm must initially present a minimum of five years of compliant performance\npresentation for the firm and each composite unless the firm or composite has been in\nexistence less than five years. For firms or composites in existence less than five years,\ncompliant performance since inception must be presented in order to claim compliance.\nAfter the initial compliant performance presentation, one year of compliant performance\nmust be added each year to a required (minimum) performance history of ten years.\nFirms may present periods of noncompliant performance immediately prior to the\ncompliant performance history as long as no noncompliant performance is presented\nfor any periods after January 1, 2000. Firms must specify which performance results\nare noncompliant and the ways in which such (noncompliant) performance does not\ncomply with GIPS.\n"}
