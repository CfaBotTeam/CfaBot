{"id": 1376, "text": "Cournot's model was an early version of what are called strategic games, decision models\nin which the best choice for a firm depends on the actions (reactions) of other firms. A\nmore general model of this strategic game was developed by Nobel Prize winner John\nNash, who developed the concept of a Nash equilibrium. A Nash equilibrium is reached\nwhen the choices of all firms are such that there is no other choice that makes any firm\nbetter off (increases profits or decreases losses).\n"}
