{"id": 444, "text": "Stratified sampling is often used in bond indexing because of the difficulty and cost\nof completely replicating the entire population of bonds. In this case, bonds in a\npopulation are categorized (stratified) according to major bond risk factors such as\nduration, maturity, coupon rate, and the like. Then, samples are drawn from each\nseparate category and combined to form a final sample.\nTo see how this works, suppose you want to construct a bond portfolio that is indexed to\nthe major municipal bond index using a stratified random sampling approach. First, the\nentire population of 1,000 municipal bonds in the index can be classified on the basis of\nmaturity and coupon rate. Then, cells (stratum) can be created for different\nmaturity/coupon combinations, and random samples can be drawn from each of the\nmaturity/coupon cells. To sample from a cell containing 50 bonds with 2- to 4-year\nmaturities and coupon rates less than 5%, we would select five bonds. The number of\nbonds drawn from a given cell corresponds to the cell's weight relative to the population\n(index), or (50 / 1000) x (100) = 5 bonds. This process is repeated for all of the\nmaturity/coupon cells, and the individual samples are combined to form the portfolio.\n"}
