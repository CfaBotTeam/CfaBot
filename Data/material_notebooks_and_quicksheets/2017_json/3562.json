{"id": 3562, "text": "For many commodities, supply is inelastic in the short run because of long lead times\nto alter production levels (e.g., drill oil wells, plant crops, or decide to plant less of\nthem). As a result, commodity prices can be volatile when demand changes significantly\nover the economic cycle. Production of some commodities, especially agricultural\ncommodities, can be significantly affected by the weather, leading to high prices when\nproduction is low and low prices when production is high. Costs of extracting oil and\nminerals increase as more expensive methods or more remote areas are used. To estimate\nfuture needs, commodities producers analyze economic events, government policy, and\nforecasts of future supply. Investors analyze inventory levels, forecasts of production,\nchanges in government policy, and expectations of economic growth in order to forecast\ncommodity prices.\n"}
