{"id": 1620, "text": "LOS 25.\nCash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid financial assets that are readily convertible\nto cash. Their balance sheet values are generally close to identical using either amortized\ncost or fair value.\nAccounts receivable are reported at net realizable value by estimating bad debt expense.\nInventories are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value (IFRS) or the lower of\ncost or market (U.S. GAAP). Cost can be measured using standard costing or the retail\nmethod. Different cost flow assumptions can affect inventory values.\nProperty, plant, and equipment (PP&E) can be reported using the cost model or the\nrevaluation model under IFRS. Under U.S. GAAP, only the cost model is allowed.\nPP&E is impaired if its carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. Recoveries of\nimpairment losses are allowed under IFRS but not U.S. GAAP.\n"}
