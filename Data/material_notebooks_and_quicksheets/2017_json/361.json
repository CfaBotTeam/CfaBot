{"id": "361", "text": "Tracking error is the difference between the total return on a portfolio and the total\nreturn on the benchmark against which its performance is measured. For example, if a\nportfolio of U.S. stocks has a return of 4% in a period when a comparable U.S. stock\nindex increases by 7% (both on a total return basis), the portfolio's tracking error for\nthat period is \u20133%.\n"}
