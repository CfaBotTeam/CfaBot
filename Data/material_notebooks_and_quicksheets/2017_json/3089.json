{"id": "3089", "text": "3. Liquidating dividends occur when a company goes out of business and distributes\nthe proceeds to shareholders. For tax purposes, a liquidating dividend is treated as a\nreturn of capital and amounts over the investor\u2019s tax basis are taxed as capital gains.\nNo matter which form cash dividends take, their net effect is to transfer cash from the\ncompany to its shareholders. The payment of a cash dividend reduces a company's assets\nand the market value of its equity. This means that immediately after a dividend is paid,\nthe price of the stock should drop by the amount of the dividend. For example, if a\ncompany's stock price is $25 per share and the company pays $1 per share as a dividend,\nthe price of the stock should immediately drop to $24 per share to account for the lower\nasset and equity values of the firm.\n"}
