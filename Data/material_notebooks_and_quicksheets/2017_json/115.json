{"id": 115, "text": "determine the median, arrange the data from the highest to the lowest value, or lowest to\nhighest value, and find the middle observation.\nThe median is important because the arithmetic mean can be affected by extremely large\nor small values (outliers). When this occurs, the median is a better measure of central\ntendency than the mean because it is not affected by extreme values that may actually be\nthe result of errors in the data.\n"}
