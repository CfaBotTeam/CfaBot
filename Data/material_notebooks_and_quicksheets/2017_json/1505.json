{"id": "1505", "text": "Economic growth can best be explained by examining five important sources of\neconomic growth:\n1. Labor supply. The labor force is the number of people over the age of 16 who\nare either working or available for work but currently unemployed. It is affected\nby population growth, net immigration, and the labor force participation rate\n(described in our topic review of Understanding Business Cycles). Growth of the\nlabor force is an important source of economic growth.\n2. Human capital. The education and skill level of a country's labor force can be just as\nimportant a determinant of economic output as the size of the labor force. Because\nworkers who are skilled and well-educated (possess more human capital) are more\nproductive and better able to take advantage of advances in technology, investment\nin human capital leads to greater economic growth.\n"}
