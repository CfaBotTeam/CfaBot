{"id": "1483", "text": "The short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve reflects the relationship between output\nand the price level when wages and other input prices are held constant (or are slow to\nadjust to higher output prices). The curve shows the total level of output that businesses\nare willing to supply at different price levels. A number of factors can affect this level of\noutput and cause the SRAS curve to shift. In Figure 9, an increase in aggregate supply is\nshown by a shift to the right, as the quantity supplied at each price level increases.\n"}
