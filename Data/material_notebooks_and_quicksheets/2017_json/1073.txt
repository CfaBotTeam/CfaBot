The domestic currency depreciates due to an outflow of foreign money as real\ninterest rates decline.\nTogether, these four factors increase domestic demand as people consume more (they\nhave less incentive to save given lower interest rates) and increase net external demand\n(exports minus imports) because depreciation of the domestic currency makes exports\nless expensive to foreigners and imports more expensive in the domestic economy. The\nincrease in overall demand and import prices tends to increase aggregate demand and\ndomestic inflation.\n"}
