{"id": "158", "text": "Skewness, or skew, refers to the extent to which a distribution is not symmetrical.\nNonsymmetrical distributions may be either positively or negatively skewed and\nresult from the occurrence of outliers in the data set. Outliers are observations with\nextraordinarily large values, either positive or negative.\nA positively skewed distribution is characterized by many outliers in the upper region,\nor right tail. A positively skewed distribution is said to be skewed right because of its\nrelatively long upper (right) tail.\nA negatively skewed distribution has a disproportionately large amount of outliers\nthat fall within its lower (left) tail. A negatively skewed distribution is said to be\nskewed left because of its long lower tail.\n"}
