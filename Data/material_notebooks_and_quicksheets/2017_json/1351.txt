{"id": 1351, "text": "Figure 6 illustrates that firms will experience economic losses when price is below\naverage total cost (P < ATC). In this case, the firm must decide whether to continue\noperating. A firm will minimize its losses in the short run by continuing to operate when\nprice is less than ATC but greater than AVC. As long as the firm is covering its variable\ncosts and some of its fixed costs, its loss will be less than its fixed (in the short run) costs.\nIf the firm is only just covering its variable costs (P = AVC), the firm is operating at its\nshutdown point. If the firm is not covering its variable costs (P < AVC) by continuing to\noperate, its losses will be greater than its fixed costs. In this case, the firm will shut down\n(zero output) and lay off its workers. This will limit its losses to its fixed costs (e.g., its\n"}
