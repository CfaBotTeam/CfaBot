During periods of rising prices, this drawdown in inventory reduces\ncost of goods sold because the lower cost of previously produced inventory is used,\nresulting in an unsustainable increase in gross profit margin.\nLOS 28.f\nTo convert a firm's financial statements from LIFO to what they would have been under\nFIFO:\n1.
