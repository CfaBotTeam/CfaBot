{"id": "1391", "text": "Figure 19 shows the revenue-cost structure facing the monopolist. Note that production\nwill expand until MR = MC at optimal output Q*. To find the price at which it will sell\nQ* units, you must go to the demand curve. The demand curve itself does not determine\nthe optimal behavior of the monopolist. Just like the perfect competition model, the\nprofit maximizing output for a monopolist is where MR = MC. To ensure a profit, the\ndemand curve must lie above the firm's average total cost (ATC) curve at the optimal\nquantity so that price > ATC. The optimal quantity will be in the elastic range of the\ndemand curve.\n"}
