{"id": "101", "text": "Answer:\nStep 1: Defining the interval. For Intelco's stock, the range of returns is 69.0%\n(-28.6% \u2013 40.4%). Using a return interval of 1% would result in\n69 separate intervals, which in this case is too many. So let's use eight\nnonoverlapping intervals with a width of 10%. The lowest return intervals\nwill be \u201330% < R < -20%, and the intervals will increase to\n40% < R < 50%.\nStep 2: Tally the observations and count the observations within each interval. The tallies\nand counts of the observations are presented in Table B.\nTable B: Tally and Interval Count for Returns Data\nInterval\nTallies\nAbsolute Frequency\n-30% < R <-20%\n-20% < R <-10%\n-10% < R < 0%\n0% < R < 10%\n///////\n10% < R < 20%\n20% < R < 30%\n30% < R < 40%\n40% < R < 50%\n"}
