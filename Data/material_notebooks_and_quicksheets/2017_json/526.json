{"id": 526, "text": "A two-tailed test for the population mean may be structured as:\nH.: = Po versus Hu= Ho\nSince the alternative hypothesis allows for values above and below the hypothesized\nparameter, a two-tailed test uses two critical values (or rejection points).\nThe general decision rule for a two-tailed test is:\nReject H, if: test statistic > upper critical value or\ntest statistic < lower critical value\nLet's look at the development of the decision rule for a two-tailed test using a\nz-distributed test statistic (a z-test) at a 5% level of significance, a = 0.05.\n\u2022 At a = 0.05, the computed test statistic is compared with the critical z-values of\n+1.96. The values of +1.96 correspond to tzl2 = 420.025, which is the range of\nz-values within which 95% of the probability lies. These values are obtained from\nthe cumulative probability table for the standard normal distribution (z-table),\nwhich is included at the back of this book.\nIf the computed test statistic falls outside the range of critical z-values (i.e., test\nstatistic > 1.96, or test statistic < -1.96), we reject the null and conclude that the\nsample statistic is sufficiently different from the hypothesized value.\nIf the computed test statistic falls within the range +1.96, we conclude that the\nsample statistic is not sufficiently different from the hypothesized value (u = bg in\nthis case), and we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\nThe decision rule (rejection rule) for a two-tailed z-test at a = 0.05 can be stated as:\n"}
