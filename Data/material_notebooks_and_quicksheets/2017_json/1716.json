{"id": 1716, "text": "LOS 26.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, dividends paid are financing cash flows. Interest paid, interest\nreceived, and dividends received are operating cash flows. All taxes paid are operating\ncash flows.\nUnder IFRS, dividends paid and interest paid can be reported as either operating or\nfinancing cash flows. Interest received and dividends received can be reported as either\noperating or investing cash flows. Taxes paid are operating cash flows unless they arise\nfrom an investing or financing transaction.\nLOS 26.d\nUnder the direct method of presenting CFO, each line item of the accrual-based income\nstatement is adjusted to get cash receipts or cash payments. The main advantage of the\ndirect method is that it presents clearly the firm's operating cash receipts and payments.\nUnder the indirect method of presenting CFO, net income is adjusted for transactions\nthat affect net income but do not affect operating cash flow, such as depreciation and\ngains or losses on asset sales, and for changes in balance sheet items. The main advantage\nof the indirect method is that it focuses on the differences between net income\nand operating cash flow. This provides a useful link to the income statement when\nforecasting future operating cash flow.\n"}
