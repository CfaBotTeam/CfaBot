{"id": "663", "text": "Technical analysts primarily use charts of price and volume to analyze asset prices and\noverall market movement. Most of these charts have time on the horizontal axis. The\ntime interval chosen (monthly, weekly, daily, or intraday periods) reflects the trading\nhorizon of interest to the analyst. A technical analyst will typically start by observing\nlonger-term trends on monthly and weekly charts, then look at recent activity on daily\nor intraday charts. If prices have changed exponentially (e.g., a stock index over several\ndecades), an analyst may choose to draw charts on a logarithmic scale instead of the\nusual linear scale.\n"}
