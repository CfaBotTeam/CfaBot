{"id": "1514", "text": "growth in potential GDP = growth in technology + W(growth in labor) +\nWC(growth in capital)\nwhere W, and W, are labor's percentage share of national income and capital's\npercentage share of national income.\nConsider a developed country where W= 0.7 and W. = 0.3. For that country, a 1%\nincrease in the labor force will lead to a much greater increase in economic output than a\n1% increase in the capital stock. Similarly, sustained growth of the labor force will result\nin greater economic growth over time than sustained growth of the capital stock of an\nequal magnitude.\nGrowth in total factor productivity is driven by improvements in technology.\nSometimes, the relationship between potential GDP, technology improvements, and\ncapital growth is written on a per-capita basis? as:\ngrowth in per-capita potential GDP = growth in technology + W. (growth in the\ncapital-to-labor ratio)\n"}
