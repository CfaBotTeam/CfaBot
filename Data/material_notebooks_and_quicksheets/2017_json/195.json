{"id": "195", "text": "17. B A distribution that has a greater percentage of small deviations from the mean and a\ngreater percentage of extremely large deviations from the mean will be leptokurtic and\nwill exhibit excess kurtosis (positive). The distribution will be more peaked and have\nfatter tails than a normal distribution.\n18. A A distribution with a mean greater than its median is positively skewed, or skewed to\nthe right. The skew \u201cpulls\u201d the mean. Note: Kurtosis deals with the overall shape of a\ndistribution and not its skewness.\n"}
