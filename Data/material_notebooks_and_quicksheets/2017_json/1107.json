{"id": "1107", "text": "A country's debt ratio is the ratio of aggregate debt to GDP. Because taxes are linked to\nGDP, when an economy grows in real terms, tax revenues will also grow in real terms.\nIf the real interest rate on the government's debt is higher than the real growth rate of\nthe economy, then the debt ratio will increase over time (keeping tax rates constant).\nSimilarly, if the real interest rate on government's debt is lower than real growth in GDP,\nthe debt ratio will decrease (i.e., improve) over time.\n"}
