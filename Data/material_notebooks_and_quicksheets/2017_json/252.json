{"id": 252, "text": "The following are properties of the covariance:\n\u2022 The covariance is a general representation of the same concept as the variance.\nThat is, the variance measures how a random variable moves with itself, and the\ncovariance measures how one random variable moves with another random variable.\nThe covariance of R, with itself is equal to the variance of Ra; that is, Cov(RA-RA) =\nVar(RA).\n\u2022 The covariance may range from negative infinity to positive infinity.\nTo aid in the interpretation of covariance, consider the returns of a stock and of a put\noption on the stock. These two returns will have a negative covariance because they\nmove in opposite directions. The returns of two automotive stocks would likely have\na positive covariance, and the returns of a stock and a riskless asset would have a zero\ncovariance because the riskless asset's returns never move, regardless of movements in the\nstock's return. While the formula for covariance given above is correct, the method of\ncomputing the covariance of returns from a joint probability model uses a probabilityweighted average of the products of the random variable's deviations from their means\nfor each possible outcome. The following example illustrates this calculation.\n"}
