{"id": "3808", "text": "For fixed-coupon bonds, on-the-run government bond yields for the same or nearest\nmaturity are frequently used as benchmarks. The benchmark may change during a\nbond's life. For a 5-year corporate bond, when issued, the benchmark spread is stated\nrelative to a 5-year government bond yield, but two years later (when it has three\nyears remaining to maturity) its benchmark spread will be stated relative to a 3-year\ngovernment bond yield. A yield spread over a government bond is also known as a\nG-spread.\n"}
