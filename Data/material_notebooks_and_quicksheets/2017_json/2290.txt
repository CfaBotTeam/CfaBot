{"id": 2290, "text": "Conflicts of interest between shareholders and managers or directors\nIn the context of a corporation, shareholders are the principals (owners), and firm\nmanagement and board members (directors) are their agents. Managers and directors\nmay choose a lower level of business risk than shareholders would. This conflict can\narise because the risk of company managers and directors is more dependent of firm\nperformance compared to the risk of shareholders, who hold diversified portfolios of\nstocks and are not dependent on the firm for employment.\n"}
