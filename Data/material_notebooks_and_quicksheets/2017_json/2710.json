B Participating preferred shares can receive extra dividends if firm profits exceed a prespecified level and a value greater than the par value if the firm is liquidated.\n3. C Private equity has less liquidity because no public market for it exists. The lower\nliquidity of private equity would increase required returns.\n4. C Global Depository Receipts are not listed on U.S. exchanges and are most often\ndenominated in U.S. dollars. They are not issued in the United States.\n5. B Callable shares are the most risky because if the market price rises, the firm can call\nin the shares, limiting the investor's potential gains. Putable shares are the least risky\nbecause if the market price drops, the investor can put the shares back to the firm at a\npredetermined price. The risk of non-putable, non-callable shares falls in between.\n6. A The primary goal of firm management is to increase the book value of equity. It increases\nwhen retained earnings are positive. The market value of equity reflects the collective\nexpectations of investors about the firm's future performance.\n7. B Net income increasing at a faster rate than book value of equity generally would be a\npositive sign. If a firm issues debt to repurchase equity, this decreases the book value\nof equity and increases the ROE. However, now the firm becomes riskier due to the\nincreased debt. Net income decreasing at a slower rate than book value of equity would\nincrease ROE, but decreasing net income is not a positive sign.\n"}
