{"id": "1910", "text": "Assuming inflation, FIFO COGS is lower than LIFO COGS, so subtracting the change\nin the LIFO reserve from LIFO COGS makes intuitive sense. When prices are falling,\nwe still subtract the change in the LIFO reserve to convert from LIFO COGS to FIFO\nCOGS. In this case, however, the change in the LIFO reserve is negative and subtracting\nit will result in higher COGS. This again makes sense. When prices are falling, FIFO\nCOGS is greater than LIFO COGS.\n"}
