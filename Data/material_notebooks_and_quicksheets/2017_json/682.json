A moving average is simply the mean of the last n closing\nprices. The larger the chosen value of n, the smoother the moving average line. Analysts\noften use moving average periods that make intuitive sense, such as 20 days to represent\nthe number of trading days in a month. In an uptrend, the price is higher than the\nmoving average, and in a downtrend, the price is lower than the moving average. Moving\naverage lines are often viewed as support or resistance levels.\n"}
