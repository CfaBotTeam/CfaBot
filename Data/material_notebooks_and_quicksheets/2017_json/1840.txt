{"id": 1840, "text": "A business segment is a portion of a larger company that accounts for more than 10% of\nthe company's revenues or assets, and is distinguishable from the company's other lines\nof business in terms of the risk and return characteristics of the segment. Geographic\nsegments are also identified when they meet the size criterion above and the geographic\nunit has a business environment that is different from that of other segments or the\nremainder of the company's business.\nBoth U.S. GAAP and IFRS require companies to report segment data, but the required\ndisclosure items are only a subset of the required disclosures for the company as a whole.\nNonetheless, an analyst can prepare a more detailed analysis and forecast by examining\nthe performance of business or geographic segments separately. Segment profit margins,\nasset utilization (turnover), and return on assets can be very useful in gaining a clear\npicture of a firm's overall operations. For forecasting, growth rates of segment revenues\nand profits can be used to estimate future sales and profits and to determine the changes\nin company characteristics over time.\n"}
