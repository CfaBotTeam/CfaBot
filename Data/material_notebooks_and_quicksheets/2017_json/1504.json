{"id": 1504, "text": "When both aggregate supply and aggregate demand change, the effects on equilibrium\noutput and the price level may be clear when the effects on the variable are in the same\ndirection (or ambiguous when the effects on the variable are in opposite directions). We\nsummarize the effects of combined changes in demand and supply in Figure 16.\nWhen aggregate demand and aggregate supply both increase, real GDP increases but\nthe effect on the price level depends on the relative magnitudes of the changes\nbecause their price effects are in opposite directions (Panel a of Figure 16).\nWhen aggregate demand and aggregate supply both decrease, real GDP decreases but\nthe effect on the price level depends on the relative magnitudes of the changes\nbecause their price effects are in opposite directions (Panel b of Figure 16).\nWhen aggregate demand increases and aggregate supply decreases, the price level will\nincrease but the effect on real GDP depends on the relative magnitudes of the\nchanges because their effects on economic output are in opposite directions (Panel o\nof Figure 16).\nWhen aggregate demand decreases and aggregate supply increases, the price level will\ndecrease but the effect on real GDP depends on the relative magnitudes of the\nchanges because their effects on economic output are in opposite directions (Panel d\nof Figure 16).\n"}
