{"id": "520", "text": "LOS 12.b: Distinguish between one-tailed and two-tailed tests of hypotheses.\nThe alternative hypothesis can be one-sided or two-sided. A one-sided test is referred to\nas a one-tailed test, and a two-sided test is referred to as a two-tailed test. Whether the\ntest is one or two-sided depends on the proposition being tested. If a researcher wants\nto test whether the return on stock options is greater than zero, a one-tailed test should\nbe used. However, a two-tailed test should be used if the research question is whether\nthe return on options is simply different from zero. Two-sided tests allow for deviation\non both sides of the hypothesized value (zero). In practice, most hypothesis tests are\nconstructed as two-tailed tests.\n"}
