{"id": "1369", "text": "2. Cournot duopoly model.\n3. Nash equilibrium model (prisoner's dilemma).\n4. Stackelberg dominant firm model.\nOne traditional model of oligopoly, the kinked demand curve model, is based on\nthe assumption that an increase in a firm's product price will not be followed by its\ncompetitors, but a decrease in price will. According to the kinked demand curve model,\neach firm believes that it faces a demand curve that is more elastic (Aatter) above a\ngiven price (the kink in the demand curve) than it is below the given price. The kinked\ndemand curve model is illustrated in Figure 12. The kink price is at price Pk, where\na firm produces QK. A firm believes that if it raises its price above PK, its competitors\nwill remain at PK, and it will lose market share because it has the highest price. Above\nPk, the demand curve is considered to be relatively elastic, where a small price increase\nwill result in a large decrease in demand. On the other hand, if a firm decreases its price\nbelow Px, other firms will match the price cut, and all firms will experience a relatively\nsmall increase in sales relative to any price reduction. Therefore, Qk is the profitmaximizing level of output.\n"}
