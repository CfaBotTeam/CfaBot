{"id": "3397", "text": "While this difference is theoretically important in some contexts, in practice it does not\nlead to any difference between the prices of forwards and futures that have the same\nterms otherwise. If interest rates are constant, or even simply uncorrelated with futures\nprices, the prices of futures and forwards are the same. A positive correlation between\ninterest rates and the futures price means that (for a long position) daily settlement\nprovides funds (excess margin) when rates are high and they can earn more interest, and\nrequires funds (margin deposits) when rates are low and opportunity cost of deposited\nfunds is less. Because of this, futures prices will be higher than forward prices when\ninterest rates and futures prices are positively correlated, and they will be lower than\nforward prices when interest rates and futures prices are negatively correlated.\n"}
