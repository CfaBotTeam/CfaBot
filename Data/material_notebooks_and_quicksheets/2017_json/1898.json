{"id": "1898", "text": "During deflationary periods and stable or increasing inventory quantities, the cost flow\neffects of using LIFO and FIFO will be reversed; that is, LIFO COGS will be lower\nand LIFO ending inventory will be higher. This makes sense because the most recent\nlower-cost purchases are assumed to be sold first under LIFO, and the units in ending\ninventory are assumed to be the earliest purchases with higher costs.\nConsider the diagram in Figure 2 to help visualize the FIFO-LIFO difference during\nperiods of rising prices and growing inventory levels.\n"}
