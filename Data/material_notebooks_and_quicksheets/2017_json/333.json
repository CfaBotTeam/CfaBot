{"id": "333", "text": "Exam Focus\nThis topic review contains a lot of key material. Learn the difference between discrete\nand continuous probability distributions. The binomial and normal distributions are the\nmost important here. You must learn the properties of both distributions and memorize\nthe formulas for the probability of a particular value when given a binomial probability\ndistribution. Learn what shortfall risk is and how to calculate and use Roy's safetyfirst criterion. Know how to standardize a normally distributed random variable, use a\nz-table, and construct confidence intervals. These skills will be used repeatedly in the\ntopic reviews that follow. Additionally, understand the basic features of the lognormal\ndistribution, Monte Carlo simulation, and historical simulation. Finally, it would be a\ngood idea to know how to get continuously compounded rates of return from holding\nperiod returns. Other than that, no problem.\n"}
