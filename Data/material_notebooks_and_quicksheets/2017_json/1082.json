{"id": "1082", "text": "If individuals and businesses believe that a decrease in the money supply intended to\nreduce inflation will be successful, they will expect lower future inflation rates. Because\nlong-term bond yields include a premium for expected inflation, long-term rates could\nfall (tending to increase economic growth), even while the central bank has increased\nshort-term rates in order to slow economic activity. Conversely, increasing the money\nsupply to stimulate economic activity could lead to an increase in expected inflation\nrates and long-term bond yields, even as short-term rates fall.\n"}
