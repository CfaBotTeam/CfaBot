{"id": 2569, "text": "The effect of the split on the price of Stock C, in the absence of any change from\nthe price at the end of day 1, would be to reduce it to $90 / 2 = $45. The index\ndenominator will be adjusted so that the index value would remain at 40 if there\nwere no changes in the stock prices other than to adjust for the split. The new\ndenominator, d, must satisfy (10 + 20 + 45) / d = 40 and equals 1.875.\n"}
