{"id": 2585, "text": "Composition of shareholders\nIf a significant portion of a company's outstanding shares are held by an affiliated\ncompany or institution, those shareholders may be able to exert enough influence to\ndictate the company's policies and direction. In some countries, it is quite common for\none company to hold a large minority stake in another company. Some claim that such\ncross-holdings between companies lead to greater stability, better cooperation between\nthe two companies, and a longer-term perspective on company performance. However,\nwhen the shareholder company tends to vote with management and to support board\nmembers with long tenure, it can hinder change by protecting the company from\npotential hostile takeovers and activist shareholders.\n"}
