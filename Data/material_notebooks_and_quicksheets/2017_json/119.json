{"id": "119", "text": "Consider that while we calculated the mean of 1, 2, 3, and 50 as 14, the median is 2.5.\nIf the data were 1, 2, 3, and 4 instead, the arithmetic mean and median would both be\n2.5.\nThe mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a data set. A data set may have\nmore than one mode or even no mode. When a distribution has one value that appears\nmost frequently, it is said to be unimodal. When a set of data has two or three values\nthat occur most frequently, it is said to be bimodal or trimodal, respectively.\n"}
