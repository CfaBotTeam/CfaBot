{"id": 1286, "text": "The spot rate on the New Zealand dollar (NZD) is NZD/USD 1.4286, and the\n180-day forward rate is NZD/USD 1.3889. This difference means:\nA. interest rates are lower in the United States than in New Zealand.\nB. interest rates are higher in the United States than in New Zealand.\nC. it takes more NZD to buy one USD in the forward market than in the spot\nmarket.\nThe monetary authority of The Stoddard Islands will exchange its currency for\nU.S. dollars at a one-for-one ratio. As a result, the exchange rate of the Stoddard\nIslands currency with the U.S. dollar is 1.00, and many businesses in the\nIslands will accept U.S. dollars in transactions. This exchange rate regime is best\ndescribed as:\nA. a fixed peg.\nB. dollarization.\nC. a currency board.\nA country that wishes to narrow its trade deficit devalues its currency. If\ndomestic demand for imports is perfectly price-inelastic, whether devaluing the\ncurrency will result in a narrower trade deficit is least likely to depend on:\nA. the size of the currency devaluation.\nB. the country's ratio of imports to exports.\nC. price elasticity of demand for the country's exports.\nA devaluation of a country's currency to improve its trade deficit would most\nlikely benefit a producer of:\nA. luxury goods for export.\nB. export goods that have no close substitutes.\nC. an export good that represents a relatively small proportion of consumer\nexpenditures.\n"}
