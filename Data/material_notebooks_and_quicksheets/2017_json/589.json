{"id": 589, "text": "While the tests considered in the previous section were of the difference between the\nmeans of two independent samples, sometimes our samples may be dependent. If the\nobservations in the two samples both depend on some other factor, we can construct a\n\"paired comparisons\u201d test of whether the means of the differences between observations\nfor the two samples are different. Dependence may result from an event that affects both\nsets of observations for a number of companies or because observations for two firms\nover time are both influenced by market returns or economic conditions.\n"}
