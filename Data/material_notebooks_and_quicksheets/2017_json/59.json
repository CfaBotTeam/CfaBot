{"id": "59", "text": "This is the geometric mean return, which we examine in more detail later. This allows\nus to express the time-weighted return as an annual compound rate, even though we\nhave two years of data. In the investment management industry, the time-weighted rate of\nreturn is the preferred method of performance measurement, because it is not affected by the\ntiming of cash inflows and outflows.\nIn the preceding examples, the time-weighted rate of return for the portfolio was\n15.84%, while the money-weighted rate of return for the same portfolio was 13.86%.\nThe results are different because the money-weighted rate of return gave a larger weight\nto the Year 2 HPR, which was 10%, versus the 22% HPR for Year 1. This is because\nthere was more money in the account at the beginning of the second period.\n"}
