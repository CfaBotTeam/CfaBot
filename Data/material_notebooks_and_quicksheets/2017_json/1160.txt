{"id": 1160, "text": "Gross domestic product over a period, typically a year, is the total value of goods and\nservices produced within a country's borders. Gross national product is similar but\nmeasures the total value of goods and services produced by the labor and capital of a\ncountry's citizens. The difference is due to non-citizen incomes of foreigners working\nwithin a country, the income of citizens who work in other countries, the income of\nforeign capital invested within a country, and the income of capital supplied by its\ncitizens to foreign countries. The income to capital owned by foreigners invested within\na country is included in the domestic country's GDP but not in its GNP. The income of\na country's citizens working abroad is included in its GNP but not in its GDP.\nGDP is more closely related to economic activity within a country and so to its\nemployment and growth.\n"}
