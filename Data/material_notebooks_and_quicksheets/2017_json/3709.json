{"id": "3709", "text": "A repurchase (repo) agreement is an arrangement by which one party sells a security to\na counterparty with a commitment to buy it back at a later date at a specified (higher)\nprice. The repurchase price is greater than the selling price and accounts for the interest\ncharged by the buyer, who is, in effect, lending funds to the seller with the security as\ncollateral. The interest rate implied by the two prices is called the repo rate, which is the\nannualized percentage difference between the two prices. A repurchase agreement for\none day is called an overnight repo and an agreement covering a longer period is called a\nterm repo. The interest cost of a repo is customarily less than the rate on bank loans or\nother short-term borrowing.\n"}
