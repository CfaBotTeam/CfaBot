{"id": "1341", "text": "In this topic review, we examine four types of markets, which we will differentiate by the\nfollowing:\nNumber of firms and their relative sizes.\nElasticity of the demand curves they face.\nWays that they compete with other firms for sales.\nEase or difficulty with which firms can enter or exit the market.\nAt one end of the spectrum is perfect competition, in which many firms produce\nidentical products, and competition forces them all to sell at the market price. At the\nother extreme, we have monopoly, where only one firm is producing the product. In\nbetween are monopolistic competition (many sellers and differentiated products) and\noligopoly (few firms that compete in a variety of ways). Each market structure has its\nown characteristics and implications for firm strategy, and we will examine each in turn.\n"}
