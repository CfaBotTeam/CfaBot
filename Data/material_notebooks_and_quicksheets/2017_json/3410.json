{"id": 3410, "text": "Finding the swap fixed rate (which is the contract rate for our off-market forwards) that\ngives the swap a zero value at initiation is not difficult if we follow our principle of noarbitrage pricing. The fixed rate payer in a swap can replicate that derivative position by\nborrowing at a fixed rate and lending the proceeds at a variable (floating) rate. For the\nswap in our example, borrowing at the fixed rate F and lending the proceeds at 90-day\nLibor will produce the same cash flows as the swap. At each date the payment due on the\nfixed-rate loan is Fn and the interest received on lending at the floating rate is Sn.\n"}
