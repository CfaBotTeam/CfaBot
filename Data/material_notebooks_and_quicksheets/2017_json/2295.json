{"id": "2295", "text": "10. B If the correlation of returns between the two assets is \u20131, the set of possible portfolio\nrisk/return combinations becomes two straight lines (see Figure 2). A portfolio of these\ntwo assets will have a positive returns variance unless the portfolio weights are those\nthat minimize the portfolio variance. Covariance is equal to the correlation coefficient\nmultiplied by the product of the standard deviations of the returns of the two stocks in\na 2-stock portfolio. If covariance is zero, then correlation is also zero, which implies that\nthere is no linear relationship between the two stocks' returns.\n11. B Portfolio B must be the portfolio that falls below the Markowitz efficient frontier\nbecause there is a portfolio (Portfolio C) that offers a higher return and lower risk.\n12. B An investor's optimal portfolio will lie somewhere on the capital allocation line, which\nbegins at the risk-free asset and runs through the optimal risky portfolio.\n"}
