{"id": 564, "text": "No monetary value for a \"token\u201d gift is given in the Standards, although it is\nrecommended that a firm establish such a monetary value for its employees. Here, again,\nthe correct answer to a question will not likely hinge on candidate's determination of\nwhat is a token gift and what is not. Questions should be clear in this regard. A business\ndinner is likely a token gift, but a week at a condominium in Aspen or tickets to the\nSuper Bowl are likely not. Always look for clues in the questions that lead you to the\nquestion-writer's preferred answer choice, such as \u201clavish\u201d entertainment and \u201cluxury\u201d\naccommodations.\n"}
