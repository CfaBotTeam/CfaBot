{"id": 1509, "text": "Sustainability of Economic Growth\nOne way to view potential GDP is with the following equation:\npotential GDP = aggregate hours worked x labor productivity\nOr, stated in terms of economic growth:\ngrowth in potential GDP = growth in labor force + growth in labor productivity\nAn economy's sustainable growth rate can be estimated by estimating the growth rate of\nlabor productivity and the growth rate of the labor force. For example, if Japan's labor\nforce is projected to shrink by 1%, while its labor productivity is expected to grow by\n2%, then we would estimate the growth in potential GDP as: -1% + 2% = 1%.\n"}
