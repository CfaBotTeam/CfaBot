{"id": 3172, "text": "Other things equal, an increase in a bond's maturity will (usually) increase its interest rate\nrisk. The present values of payments made further in the future are more sensitive to\nchanges in the discount rate used to calculate present value than are the present values of\npayments made sooner.\nWe must say \"usually\u201d because there are instances where an increase in a discount\ncoupon bond's maturity will decrease its Macaulay duration. For a discount bond,\nduration first increases with longer maturity and then decreases over a range of relatively\nlong maturities until it approaches the duration of a perpetuity, which is (1 + YTM) /\nYTM.\n"}
