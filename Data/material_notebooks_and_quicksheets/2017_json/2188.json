{"id": "2188", "text": "The risk budget may be a single metric, such as portfolio beta, value at risk, portfolio\nduration, or returns variance. A risk budget may be constructed based on categories of\ninvestments, such as domestic equities, domestic debt securities, international equities,\nand international debt securities. Another way to allocate a risk budget is to identify\nspecific risk factors that comprise the overall risk of the portfolio or organization. In this\ncase, specific risk factors that affect asset classes to varying degrees, such as interest rate\nrisk, equity market risk, and foreign exchange rate risk, are estimated and aggregated to\ndetermine whether they match the overall risk tolerance of the organization.\n"}
