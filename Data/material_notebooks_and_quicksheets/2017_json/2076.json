{"id": "2076", "text": "Example: Impact of share repurchase and cash dividend of equal amounts\nSpencer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (SPI) has 20,000,000 shares outstanding with a current\nmarket value of $50 per share. SPI made $100 million in profits for the recent quarter,\nand because only 70% of these profits will be reinvested back into the company, SPI's\nBoard of Directors is considering two alternatives for distributing the remaining 30%\nto shareholders:\n\u2022 Pay a cash dividend of $30,000,000 / 20,000,000 shares = $1.50 per share.\n\u2022 Repurchase $30,000,000 worth of common stock.\nAssume that dividends are received when the shares go ex-dividend, the stock can be\nrepurchased at the market price of $50 per share, and there are no differences in tax\ntreatment between the two alternatives. How would the wealth of an SPI shareholder\nbe affected by the board's decision on the method of distribution?\nAnswer:\n(1) Cash dividend\nAfter the shares go ex-dividend, a shareholder of a single share would have $1.50 in\ncash and a share worth $50 \u2013 $1.50 = $48.50.\nThe ex-dividend value of $48.50 can also be calculated as the market value of equity\nafter the distribution of the $30 million, divided by the number of shares outstanding\nafter the dividend payment:\n(20,000,000)($50) \u2013 $30,000,000\nP = $48.50\n20,000,000\ntotal wealth from the ownership of one share = $48.50 + $1.50 = $50\n(2) Share repurchase\nWith $30,000,000, SPI could repurchase $30,000,000 / $50 = 600,000 shares of\ncommon stock. The share price after the repurchase is calculated as the market value\nof equity after the $30,000,000 repurchase divided by the shares outstanding after the\nrepurchase:\n(20,000,000) ($50) \u2013 $30,000,000 $970,000,000\n2= $50\n20,000,000 \u2013 600,000 19,400,000\ntotal wealth from the ownership of one share = $50\n"}
