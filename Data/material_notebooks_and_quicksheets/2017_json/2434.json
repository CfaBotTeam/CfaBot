{"id": "2434", "text": "The financial system also provides a mechanism to determine the rate of return\nthat equates the amount of borrowing with the amount of lending (saving) in an\neconomy. Low rates of return increase borrowing but reduce saving (increase current\nconsumption). High rates of return increase saving but reduce borrowing. The\nequilibrium interest rate is the rate at which the amount individuals, businesses, and\ngovernments desire to borrow is equal to the amount that individuals, businesses, and\ngovernments desire to lend. Equilibrium rates for different types of borrowing and\nlending will differ due to differences in risk, liquidity, and maturity.\n"}
