{"id": 2802, "text": "The Gordon growth model (or constant growth model) assumes the annual growth\nrate of dividends, ge, is constant. Hence, next period's dividend, D, is D,(1 + g), the\nsecond year's dividend, D, is D,(1 + g.), and so on. The extended equation using this\nassumption gives the present value of the expected future dividends (V,) as:\nVo =\nDo (1 + gc)Do (1 + g.)? Do (1 +g.)3. Do (1 + g.)\n(1+ke) (1+k.)2(1+k.)3 **(1+k.)\n"}
