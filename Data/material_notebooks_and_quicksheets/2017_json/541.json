{"id": "541", "text": "The decision for a hypothesis test is to either reject the null hypothesis or fail to\nreject the null hypothesis. Note that it is statistically incorrect to say \u201caccept\u201d the null\nhypothesis; it can only be supported or rejected. The decision rule for rejecting or failing\nto reject the null hypothesis is based on the distribution of the test statistic. For example,\nif the test statistic follows a normal distribution, the decision rule is based on critical\nvalues determined from the standard normal distribution (z-distribution). Regardless\nof the appropriate distribution, it must be determined if a one-tailed or two-tailed\nhypothesis test is appropriate before a decision rule (rejection rule) can be determined.\nA decision rule is specific and quantitative. Once we have determined whether a one- or\ntwo-tailed test is appropriate, the significance level we require, and the distribution of\nthe test statistic, we can calculate the exact critical value for the test statistic. Then we\nhave a decision rule of the following form: if the test statistic is (greater, less than) the\nvalue X, reject the null.\n"}
