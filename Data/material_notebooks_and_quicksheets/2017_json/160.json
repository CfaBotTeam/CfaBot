{"id": 160, "text": "Professor's Note: The key to remembering how measures of central tendency are\naffected by skewed data is to recognize that skew affects the mean more than the\nmedian and mode, and the mean is \"pulled\" in the direction of the skew. The\nrelative location of the mean, median, and mode for different distribution shapes\nis shown in Figure 5. Note the median is between the other two measures for\npositively or negatively skewed distributions.\n"}
