{"id": "3593", "text": "Convertible Bonds\nConvertible bonds, typically issued with maturities of 5-10 years, give bondholders the\noption to exchange the bond for a specific number of shares of the issuing corporation's\ncommon stock. This gives bondholders the opportunity to profit from increases in the\nvalue of the common shares. Regardless of the price of the common shares, the value of\na convertible bond will be at least equal to its bond value without the conversion option.\nBecause the conversion option is valuable to bondholders, convertible bonds can be\nissued with lower yields compared to otherwise identical straight bonds.\n"}
