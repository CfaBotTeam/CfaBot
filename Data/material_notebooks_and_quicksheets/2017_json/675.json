At a support level, buying is expected to emerge that\nprevents further price decreases. At a resistance level, selling is expected to emerge that\nprevents further price increases. In addition to trendlines, support and resistance levels\nfrequently appear at psychologically important prices such as round-number prices or\nhistorical highs and lows.\n"}
