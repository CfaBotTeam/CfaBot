{"id": 1290, "text": "As we continue to add additional workers to a fixed amount of capital, at some point,\nadding one more worker will increase total product by less than the addition of the\nprevious worker, although total product continues to increase. When we reach the\nquantity of labor for which the additional output for each additional worker begins to\ndecline, we have reached the point of diminishing marginal productivity of labor, or\nthat labor has reached the point of diminishing marginal returns. Beyond this quantity\nof labor, the additional output from each additional worker continues to decline.\nThere is, theoretically, some quantity for labor for which the marginal product of\nlabor is actually negative (i.e., the addition of one more worker actually decreases total\noutput).\n"}
