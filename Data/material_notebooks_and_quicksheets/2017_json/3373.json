{"id": 3373, "text": "SO = E(ST) / (1 + Rf + risk premium)T + PV (benefits of holding the asset for time\nT) \u2013 PV (costs of holding the asset for time T),\nwhere:\nSy is the current spot price of the asset and E(ST) is the expected value of the asset at\ntime T, the end of the expected holding period.\nWe assume that investors are risk-averse so they require a positive premium (higher\nreturn) on risky assets. An investor who is risk-neutral would require no risk premium\nand, as a result, would discount the expected future value of an asset at the risk-free rate.\n"}
