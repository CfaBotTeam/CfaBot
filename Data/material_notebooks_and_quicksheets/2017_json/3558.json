{"id": "3558", "text": "Futures, forwards, options, and swaps are all available forms of commodity derivatives.\nFutures trade on exchanges; some options trade on exchanges while others trade over\nthe counter; and forwards and swaps are over-the-counter instruments originated by\ndealers. Futures and forwards are contractual obligations to buy or sell a commodity at a\nspecified price and time. Options convey the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell\na commodity at a specified price and time. Other methods of exposures to commodities\ninclude the following:\nExchange-traded funds (commodity ETFs) are suitable for investors who are limited\nto buying equity shares. ETFs can invest in commodities or commodity futures and\ncan track prices or indices.\nEquities that are directly linked to a commodity include shares of a commodity\nproducer, such as an oil producer or a gold mining firm, and give investors\nexposure to price changes of the produced commodity. One potential drawback to\ncommodity-linked equities is that the price movements of the stock and the price\nmovements of the commodity may not be perfectly correlated.\nManaged futures funds are actively managed. Some managers concentrate on\nspecific sectors (e.g., agricultural commodities) while others are more diversified.\nManaged future funds can be structured as limited partnerships with fees like those\nof hedge funds (e.g., 2 and 20) and restrictions on the number, net worth, and\nliquidity of the investors. They can also be structured like mutual funds with shares\nthat are publicly traded so that retail investors can also benefit from professional\nmanagement. Additionally, such a structure allows a lower minimum investment and\ngreater liquidity compared to a limited partnership structure.\n"}
