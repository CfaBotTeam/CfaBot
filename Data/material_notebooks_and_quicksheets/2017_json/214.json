The use of odds at the horse track lets you know how much you will win\nper $1 bet on a horse (less the track's percentage). If you bet on a 15-1 long shot\nand the horse wins, you will receive $15 and your $1 bet will be returned, so the\nprofit is $15. Of course, if the horse loses, you would lose the $1 you bet and the\n\"profit\u201d is \u2013$1.\nOne last point is that the expected return on the bet is zero, based on the\nprobability of winning expressed in the odds. The probability of the horse\nwinning when the odds are 15-to-1 is_1=1 and the probability of the\n\"15+1 16\n"}
