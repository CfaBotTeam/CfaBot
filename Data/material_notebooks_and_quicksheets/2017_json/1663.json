When using the direct method, ignore depreciation expense\u2014it's a\nnoncash charge. We'll see later that we do consider depreciation expense in indirect\nmethod computations, but we do this solely because depreciation expense and\nother noncash expenses have been subtracted in calculating net income (our\nstarting point) and need to be added back to get cash flow.\n"}
