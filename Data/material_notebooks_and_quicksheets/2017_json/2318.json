The first factor is often the expected excess\nreturn on the market, E(R - R).\nOne multifactor model that is often used is that of Fama and French. They estimated the\nsensitivity of security returns to three factors: firm size, firm book value to market value\nratio, and the return on the market portfolio minus the risk-free rate (excess return on\nthe market portfolio). Carhart suggests a fourth factor that measures price momentum\nusing prior period returns. Together, these four factors do a relatively good job of\nexplaining returns differences for U.S. equity securities over the period for which the\nmodel has been estimated.\n"}
