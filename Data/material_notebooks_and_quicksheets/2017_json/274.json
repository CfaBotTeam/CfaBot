{"id": "274", "text": "The variance of a 3-asset portfolio return is determined using the formula:\nVar(R) = wx\u00b00?(RX) + wy?o(RY) + wz/0(Rz) + 2wywyCov(R,Ry) +\n2wxwzCov(Ry,R2) + 2wywzCov(R,,R2)\nHere we must make use of the relationship Cov(R,R) = 0 (R,)o(R,)P(R,R), since we\nare not provided with the covariances.\nLet's solve for the covariances, then substitute the resulting values into the portfolio\nreturn variance equation.\nCov(R,,R,y) = (0.0016)+(0.0036)Y(0.46) = 0.001104\nCov(R,R) = (0.0016)Y(0.0100)+(0.22) = 0.000880\nCov(R,, R= (0.0036)(0.0100)+(0.64) = 0.003840\nNow we can solve for the variance of the portfolio returns as:\nVar(Rp) = (0.20)2(0.0016) + (0.30)?(0.0036) + (0.50)?(0.01) +\n(2)(0.2)(0.3)(0.001104) + (2)(0.2)(0.5)(0.00088) +\n(2)(0.3)(0.5)(0.00384)\nVar(Rp) = 0.004348\nThe standard deviation of portfolio returns = (0.004348)1/2 = 0.0659 = 6.59%\n"}
