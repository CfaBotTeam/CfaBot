{"id": "1473", "text": "In the short run, the SRAS curve slopes upward because some input prices will change\nas production is increased or decreased. We assume in the short run that output prices\nwill change proportionally to the price level but that at least some input prices are sticky,\nmeaning that they do not adjust to changes in the price level in the short run. When\noutput prices increase, the price level increases, but firms see no change in input prices\nin the short run. Firms respond by increasing output in anticipation of greater profits\nfrom higher output prices. The result is an upward-sloping SRAS curve.\n"}
