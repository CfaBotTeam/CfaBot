{"id": "2823", "text": "For dividend-paying firms with dividends that are expected to grow rapidly, slowly, or\nerratically over some period, followed by constant dividend growth, some form of the\nmultistage growth model should be employed. The important points are that dividends\nmust be estimable and must grow at a constant rate after some initial period so that the\nconstant growth model can be used to determine the terminal value of the stock. Thus,\nwe can apply multistage dividend growth models to a firm with high current growth that\nwill drop to a stable rate in the future or to a firm that is temporarily losing market share\nand growing slowly or getting smaller, as long as its growth is expected to stabilize to a\nconstant rate at some point in the future.\nOne variant of a multistage growth model assumes that the firm has three stages\nof dividend growth, not just two. These three stages can be categorized as growth,\ntransition, and maturity. A 3-stage model would be suitable for firms with an initial\nhigh growth rate, followed by a lower growth rate during a second, transitional period,\nfollowed by the constant growth rate in the long run, such as a young firm still in the\nhigh growth phase.\n"}
