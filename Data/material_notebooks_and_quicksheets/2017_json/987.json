{"id": "987", "text": "For both consumer and producer prices, analysts and policymakers often distinguish\nbetween headline inflation and core inflation. Headline inflation refers to price indexes\nfor all goods. Core inflation refers to price indexes that exclude food and energy. Food\nand energy prices are typically more volatile than those of most other goods. Thus, core\ninflation can sometimes be a more useful measure of the underlying trend in prices.\n"}
