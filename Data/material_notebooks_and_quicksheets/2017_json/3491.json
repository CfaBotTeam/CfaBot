{"id": "3491", "text": "The desirability of writing a covered call to enhance income depends upon the chance\nthat the stock price will exceed the exercise price at which the trader writes the call. In\nthis example, the writer of the call thinks the stock's upside potential is less than the\nbuyer expects. The buyer of the call is paying $4 to get any gain above $55, while the\nseller has traded the upside potential above $55 for a payment of $4.\n"}
