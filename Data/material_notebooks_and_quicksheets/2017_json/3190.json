{"id": "3190", "text": "A bond's convexity is increased or decreased by the same bond characteristics that affect\nduration. A longer maturity, a lower coupon rate, or a lower yield to maturity will all\nincrease convexity, and vice versa. For two bonds with equal duration, the one with cash\nflows that are more dispersed over time will have the greater convexity.\n"}
