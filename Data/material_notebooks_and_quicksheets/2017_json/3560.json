{"id": 3560, "text": "Potential Benefits and Risks of Commodities\nReturns on commodities over time have been lower than returns on global stocks\nor bonds. Sharpe ratios for commodities as an asset class have been low due to these\nlower returns and the high volatility of commodities prices. As with other investments,\nspeculators can earn high returns over short periods when their expectations about shortterm commodity price movements are correct and they act on them.\nHistorically, correlations of commodity returns with those of global equities and global\nbonds have been low, typically less than 0.2, so that adding commodities to a traditional\nportfolio can provide diversification benefits. Because commodity prices tend to move\nwith inflation rates, holding commodities can act as a hedge of inflation risk. To the\nextent that commodities prices move with inflation the real return over time would be\nzero, although futures contracts may offer positive real returns.\n"}
