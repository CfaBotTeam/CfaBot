{"id": 2471, "text": "An investor who owns an asset, or has the right or obligation under a contract to\npurchase an asset, is said to have a long position. A short position can result from\nborrowing an asset and selling it, with the obligation to replace the asset in the future (a\nshort sale). The party to a contract who must sell or deliver an asset in the future is also\nsaid to have a short position. In general, investors who are long benefit from an increase\nin the price of an asset and those who are short benefit when the asset price declines.\nHedgers use short positions in one asset to hedge an existing risk from a long position\nin another asset that has returns that are strongly correlated with the returns of the\nasset shorted. For example, wheat farmers may take a short position in (i.e., sell) wheat\nfutures contracts. If wheat prices fall, the resulting increase in the value of the short\nfutures position offsets, partially or fully, the loss in the value of the farmer's crop.\n"}
