{"id": 1387, "text": "Clearly, there are many possible outcomes in oligopoly markets that depend on the\ncharacteristics of the firms and the market itself. The important point is that the firms'\ndecisions are interdependent so that the expected reaction of other firms is an important\nconsideration. Overall, the resulting price will be somewhere between the price based on\nperfect collusion that would maximize total profits to all firms in the market (actually\nthe monopoly price, which is addressed next) and the price that would result from\nperfect competition and generate zero economic profits in the long run. These two\nlimiting outcomes are illustrated in Figure 18 as Pcollusion with Qcollusion for perfect\ncollusion and Pcompetition and competition for perfect competition.\n"}
