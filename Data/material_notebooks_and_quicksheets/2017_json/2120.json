The firm should have the ability to prepay short-term borrowings\nwhen cash flow permits and have the flexibility to structure its short-term financing\nso that the debt matures without peaks and can be matched to expected cash flows.\nFor large borrowers, it is important that the firm has alternative sources of short-term\nfunding and even alternative lenders for a particular type of financing. It is often worth\nhaving slightly higher overall short-term funding costs in order to have flexibility and\nredundant sources of financing.\n"}
