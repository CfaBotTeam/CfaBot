{"id": "575", "text": "State the decision rule regarding the hypothesis. The = sign in the alternative hypothesis\nindicates that the test is two-tailed with two rejection regions, one in each tail of the\nstandard normal distribution curve. Because the total area of both rejection regions\ncombined is 0.05 (the significance level), the area of the rejection region in each tail\nis 0.025. You should know that the critical z-values for 120.025 are 41.96. This means\nthat the null hypothesis should not be rejected if the computed z-statistic lies between\n-1.96 and +1.96 and should be rejected if it lies outside of these critical values. The\ndecision rule can be stated as:\n"}
