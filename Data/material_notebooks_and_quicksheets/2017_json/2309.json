{"id": "2309", "text": "Investors who believe market prices are informationally efficient often follow a passive\ninvestment strategy (i.e., invest in an index of risky assets that serves as a proxy for the\nmarket portfolio and allocate a portion of their investable assets to a risk-free asset, such\nas short-term government securities). In practice, many investors and portfolio managers\nbelieve their estimates of security values are correct and market prices are incorrect. Such\ninvestors will not use the weights of the market portfolio but will invest more than the\nmarket weights in securities that they believe are undervalued and less than the market\nweights in securities which they believe are overvalued. This is referred to as active\nportfolio management to differentiate it from a passive investment strategy that utilizes\na market index for the optimal risky asset portfolio.\n"}
