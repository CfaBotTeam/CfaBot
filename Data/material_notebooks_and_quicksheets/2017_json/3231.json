{"id": "3231", "text": "5. C Because bonds with embedded options have cash flows that are uncertain and depend on\nfuture interest rates, effective duration must be used.\n6. c Other things equal, Macaulay duration is less when yield is higher and when maturity\nis shorter. The bond with the highest yield and shortest maturity must have the lowest\nMacaulay duration.\n7. A Portfolio duration is limited as a measure of interest rate risk because it assumes parallel\nshifts in the yield curve; that is, the discount rate at each maturity changes by the same\namount. Portfolio duration can be calculated using effective durations of bonds with\nembedded options. By definition, a portfolio's internal rate of return is equal to its cash\nflow yield.\n8. B PVBP = initial price - price if yield is changed by 1 basis point. First, we need to\ncalculate the yield so we can calculate the price of the bond with a 1 basis point change\nin yield. Using a financial calculator: PV= -1,029.23; FV= 1,000; PMT= 27.5 = (0.055\nx 1,000) / 2; N =14 = 2 x 7 years; CPT + I/Y = 2.49998, multiplied by 2 = 4.99995,\nor 5.00%. Next, compute the price of the bond at a yield of 5.00% + 0.01%, or\n5.01%. Using the calculator: FV= 1,000; PMT= 27.5; N = 14; I/Y = 2.505 (5.01 / 2);\nCPT + PV= $1,028.63. Finally, PVBP = $1,029.23 \u2013 $1,028.63 = $0.60.\n9. B When the YTM of a callable bond falls, the increase in price is less than for an optionfree bond because both bond price and the value of the call option increase. Callable\nbond value = straight bond value \u2013 call option value.\n10. B The interest rate sensitivity of a bond with an embedded call option will be less than\nthat of an option-free bond. Effective duration takes the effect of the call option into\naccount and will, therefore, be less than Macaulay or modified duration.\n"}
