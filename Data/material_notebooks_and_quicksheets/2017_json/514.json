{"id": "514", "text": "Exam Focus\nThis review addresses common hypothesis testing procedures. These procedures are\nused to conduct tests of population means, population variances, differences in means,\ndifferences in variances, and mean differences. Specific tests reviewed include the z-test,\nt-test, chi-square test, and F-test. You should know when and how to apply each of\nthese. A standard hypothesis testing procedure is utilized in this review. Know it! You\nshould be able to perform a hypothesis test on the value of the mean without being\ngiven any formulas. Confidence intervals, levels of significance, the power of a test, and\ntypes of hypothesis testing errors are also discussed. Don't worry about memorizing the\nmessy formulas on testing for the equalities and differences in means and variances at the\nend of this review, but be able to interpret these statistics.\n"}
