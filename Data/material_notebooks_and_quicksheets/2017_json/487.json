{"id": 487, "text": "For example, research findings may indicate that small stocks outperformed large stocks\nduring 1980\u20131985. This may well be the result of time-period bias\u2014in this case, using\ntoo short a time period. It's not clear whether this relationship will continue in the\nfuture or if it is just an isolated occurrence.\nOn the other hand, a study that quantifies the relationship between inflation and\nunemployment during the period from 1940\u20132000 will also result in time-period bias\u2014\nbecause this period is too long, and it covers a fundamental change in the relationship\nbetween inflation and unemployment that occurred in the 1980s. In this case, the data\nshould be divided into two subsamples that span the period before and after the change.\n"}
