{"id": "3327", "text": "Another method of internal credit enhancement is to divide a bond issue into tranches\n(French for slices) with different seniority of claims. Any losses due to poor performance\nof the assets supporting a securitized bond are first absorbed by the bonds with the\nlowest seniority, then the bonds with the next-lowest priority of claims. The most senior\ntranches in this structure can receive very high credit ratings because the probability is\nvery low that losses will be so large that they cannot be absorbed by the subordinated\ntranches. The subordinated tranches must have higher yields to compensate investors for\nthe additional risk of default. This is sometimes referred to as waterfall structure because\navailable funds first go to the most senior tranche of bonds, then to the next-highest\npriority bonds, and so forth.\n"}
