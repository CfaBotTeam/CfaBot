{"id": 530, "text": "Since 6.33 > 1.96, we reject the null hypothesis that the mean daily option return is\nequal to zero. Note that when we reject the null, we conclude that the sample value is\nsignificantly different from the hypothesized value. We are saying that the two values\nare different from one another after considering the variation in the sample. That is,\nthe mean daily return of 0.001 is statistically different from zero given the sample's\nstandard deviation and size.\n"}
