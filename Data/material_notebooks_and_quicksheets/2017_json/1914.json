{"id": 1914, "text": "Activity. Inventory turnover (COGS / average inventory) is higher for firms that use\nLIFO compared to firms that use FIFO. Under LIFO, COGS is valued at more recent,\nhigher costs (higher numerator), while inventory is valued at older, lower costs (lower\ndenominator). Adjusting to FIFO values will result in lower turnover and higher days of\ninventory on hand (365 / inventory turnover).\n"}
