{"id": 433, "text": "D. $8.925 is the result of a single up move, 8.50(1.05) = 8.925. With three periods, this\nprice could only result from two up moves and one down move (in any order). The\nprobabilities of prices after n periods follow a binomial distribution. Define an up move\nas a success so that the probability of a success (p) is 0.60, the probability of an up move.\nThe probability of two successes in three trials is 30, (0.6)2 (1 \u2013 0.6) = 43.2%. This\ncalculation takes account of all three possible price paths that include two up moves and\none down move: uud, udu, and duu.\nE. The price will be unchanged after six periods only if the price path includes three up.\nmoves and three down moves. The probability of three successes (up moves) in six trials\nis: C3 (0.6)3 (1 \u2013 0.6) 3 = 27.65%.\n2. A. To construct a Monte Carlo simulation, the analyst would need to:\n1. Identify the distributions that the input variables follow and their means, variances,\nand any other relevant parameters, such as skewness.\n2. Generate random values from these distributions for both input variables.\n3. Price the option using the randomly generated inputs.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for many trials. Calculate the mean option price from all the\ntrials. This value is the simulation's estimate of the option value.\nB. Whether the results from a Monte Carlo simulation are useful depends on how well the\nanalyst has specified the distributions of the interest rate and the stock price (the old,\ngarbage in-garbage out problem). Also, the simulation results contain no information\nabout whether the valuation model itself is valid.\n"}
