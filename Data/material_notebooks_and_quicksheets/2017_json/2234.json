{"id": "2234", "text": "Evaluating investments using expected return and variance of returns is a simplification\nbecause returns do not follow a normal distribution; distributions are negatively skewed,\nwith greater kurtosis (fatter tails) than a normal distribution. The negative skew reflects\na tendency towards large downside deviations, while the positive excess kurtosis reflects\nfrequent extreme deviations on both the upside and downside. These non-normal\ncharacteristics of skewness (= 0) and kurtosis (= 3) should be taken into account when\nanalyzing investments.\n"}
