{"id": 3536, "text": "Incentive fees for private equity funds are typically 20% of profits, but these fees are\nnot earned until after the fund has returned investors\u2019 initial capital. It is possible that\nincentive fees paid over time may exceed 20% of the profits realized when all portfolio\ncompanies have been liquidated. This situation arises when returns on portfolio\ncompanies are high early and decline later. A clawback provision requires the manager to\nreturn any periodic incentive fees to investors that would result in investors receiving less\nthan 80% of the profits generated by portfolio investments as a whole.\n"}
