{"id": 3261, "text": "Eurobonds are issued outside the jurisdiction of any one country and denominated in\na currency different from the currency of the countries in which they are sold. They are\nsubject to less regulation than domestic bonds in most jurisdictions and were initially\nintroduced to avoid U.S. regulations. Eurobonds should not be confused with bonds\ndenominated in euros or thought to originate in Europe, although they can be both.\nEurobonds got the \u201ceuro\u201d name because they were first introduced in Europe, and most\nare still traded by firms in European capitals. A bond issued by a Chinese firm that is\ndenominated in yen and traded in markets outside Japan would fit the definition of a\nEurobond. Eurobonds that trade in the national bond market of a country other than\nthe country that issues the currency the bond is denominated in, and in the Eurobond\nmarket, are referred to as global bonds.\n"}
