{"id": "3494", "text": "What we should observe in Figure 5 is that:\n\u2022 A protective put cuts your downside losses (maximum loss = $4) but leaves the\nupside potential alone (unlimited upside gains).\nYour maximum loss occurs at any price below $100.\nLosses between $0 and $4 occur for stock prices between $100 and $104.\nYou will not make a profit until the stock price exceeds $104 (breakeven).\n\u2022 Breakeven price = S, + premium.\nNote that a protective put (stock plus a put) has the same shape profit diagram as a long call.\nIt could be replicated with a bond that pays (X - premium) at expiration and a call at X.\n"}
