{"id": "3375", "text": "In markets for traditional securities, we don't often encounter two assets that have the\nsame future payoffs. With derivative securities, however, the risk of the derivative is\nentirely based on the risk of the underlying asset, so we can construct a portfolio of the\nunderlying asset and a derivative based on it that has no uncertainty about its value at\nsome future date (i.e., a hedged portfolio). Because the future payoff is certain, we can\ncalculate the present value of the portfolio as the future payoff discounted at the risk-free\nrate. This will be the current value of the portfolio under the no-arbitrage condition,\nwhich will force the return on a risk-free (hedged) portfolio to the risk-free rate. This\nstructure, with a long position in the asset and a short position in the derivative security,\ncan be represented as:\n"}
