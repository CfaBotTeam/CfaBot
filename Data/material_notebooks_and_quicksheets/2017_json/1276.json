{"id": 1276, "text": "LOS 20.f\nIf a forward exchange rate does not correctly reflect the difference between the interest\nrates for two currencies, an arbitrage opportunity for a riskless profit exists. In this case,\nborrowing one currency, converting it to the other currency at the spot rate, investing\nthe proceeds for the period, and converting the end-of-period amount back to the\nborrowed currency at the forward rate will produce more than enough to pay off the\ninitial loan, with the remainder being a riskless profit on the arbitrage transaction.\n"}
