You should instead\nfocus on the fact that both of these tests involve t-statistics and depend on the\ndegrees of freedom. Also note that when samples are independent, you can use\nthe difference in means test, and when they are dependent, the statistic is the\naverage difference in (paired) observations divided by the standard error of the\ndifferences between observations.\n"}
