{"id": 1433, "text": "1. B The demand for products from firms competing in monopolistic competition is\nrelatively elastic due to the availability of many close substitutes. If a firm increases its\nproduct price, it will lose customers to firms selling substitute products at lower prices.\n2. C An oligopolistic industry has a great deal of interdependence among firms. One firm's\npricing decisions or advertising activities will affect the other firms.\n3. C Monopolists must search for the profit maximizing price (and output) because they do\nnot have perfect information regarding demand. Firms under perfect competition take\nthe market price as given and only determine the profit maximizing quantity.\n4. A A monopolist will expand production until MR = MC, and the price of the product will\nbe determined by the demand curve.\n5. c When a regulatory agency requires a monopolist to use average cost pricing, the intent\nis to price the product where the ATC curve intersects the market demand curve. A\nproblem in using this method is actually determining exactly what the ATC is.\n6. A When a firm operates under conditions of pure competition, MR always equals price.\nThis is because, in pure competition, demand is perfectly elastic (a horizontal line), so\nMR is constant and equal to price.\n7. B The supply function is not well-defined in markets other than those that can be\ncharacterized as perfect competition.\n8. A In a purely competitive market, economic losses indicate that firms are overproducing,\ncausing prices to fall below average total costs. This can occur in the short run. In the\nlong run, however, market supply will decrease as firms exit the industry, and prices will\nrise to the point where economic profits are zero.\n9. C A purely competitive firm will tend to expand its output so long as the market price is\ngreater than MC. In the short run and long run, profit is maximized when P = MC.\n10. C The kinked demand model assumes that each firm in a market believes that at some\nprice, demand is more elastic for a price increase than for a price decrease.\n11. A The Nash equilibrium results when each nation pursues the strategy that is best, given\nthe strategy that is pursued by the other nation.\n\u2022 Given that Germany complies with the agreement: France will get \u20ac8 billion if it\ncomplies, but \u20ac10 billion if it defaults. Therefore, France should default.\nGiven that Germany defaults: France will get \u20ac2 billion if it complies, but \u20ac4\nbillion if it defaults. Therefore, France should default.\nBecause France is better off in either case by defaulting, France will default.\nGermany will follow the same logic and reach the same conclusion.\n12. C If price is greater than average variable cost, a firm will continue to operate in the short\nrun because it is covering at least some of its fixed costs.\n"}
