{"id": "1266", "text": "Whether a currency depreciation has these effects depends on the current level of\ncapacity utilization in the economy. When an economy is operating at less than full\nemployment, the currency depreciation makes domestic goods and assets relatively more\nattractive than foreign goods and assets. The resulting shift in demand away from foreign\ngoods and assets and towards domestic goods and assets will increase both expenditures\nand income. Because part of the income increase will be saved, national income will\nincrease more than total expenditure, improving the balance of trade.\n"}
