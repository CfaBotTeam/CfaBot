{"id": "2251", "text": "In this unique case, with P12 = 1, the portfolio standard deviation is simply a weighted\naverage of the standard deviations of the individual asset returns. A portfolio 25%\ninvested in Asset 1 and 75% invested in Asset 2 will have a standard deviation of returns\nequal to 25% of the standard deviation (0,) of Asset l's return, plus 75% of the standard\ndeviation (0,) of Asset 2's return.\nFocusing on returns correlation, we can see that the greatest portfolio risk results when\nthe correlation between asset returns is +1. For any value of correlation less than +1,\nportfolio variance is reduced. Note that for a correlation of zero, the entire third term in\nthe portfolio variance equation is zero. For negative values of correlation P12, the third\nterm becomes negative and further reduces portfolio variance and standard deviation.\n"}
