This allows us\nto determine how much of any good we are foregoing when consuming another.\nMoney provides a store of value because money received for work or goods now can\nbe saved to purchase goods later.\nNarrow money is the amount of notes (currency) and coins in circulation in an economy\nplus balances in checkable bank deposits. Broad money includes narrow money plus any\namount available in liquid assets, which can be used to make purchases.\n"}
