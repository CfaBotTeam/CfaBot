Why or why not?\nIn the first step, decision makers need to identify the facts they have to work with,\nand the facts they would like to have, before making a decision. Stakeholders\u2014those\naffected by the decision\u2014must be identified. These stakeholders may include the\nemployer, clients, co-workers, self, family, and others in the industry, and the duties to\neach stakeholder should be identified. This part of the process will also help in explicitly\nidentifying potential conflicts of interest among the various stakeholders.
