{"id": 3396, "text": "Forwards and futures serve the same function in gaining exposure to or hedging specific\nrisks, but differ in their degree of standardization, liquidity, and, in many instances,\ncounterparty risk. From a pricing and valuation perspective, the most important\ndistinction is that futures gains and losses are settled each day and the margin balance\nis adjusted accordingly. If gains put the margin balance above the initial margin level,\nany funds in excess of that level can be withdrawn. If losses put the margin value below\nthe minimum margin level, funds must be deposited to restore the account margin to its\ninitial (required) level. Forwards, typically, do not require or provide funds in response\nto fluctuations in value during their lives.\n"}
