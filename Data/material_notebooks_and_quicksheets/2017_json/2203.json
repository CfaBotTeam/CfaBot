Some\nrisks may be mitigated by diversification, some shifted by insurance where it is available\nand economical, some shifted though the use of derivatives, and some simply borne or\nself-insured. The end result is a risk profile that matches the risk tolerance established for\nthe organization and includes the risks that top management has determined match the\ngoals of the organization in terms of cost versus potential returns.\n"}
