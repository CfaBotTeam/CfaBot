Examples\ninclude uncollected receivables and bad debts, obsolete inventory (takes longer to sell\nand can require sharp price discounts), and tight short-term credit due to economic\nconditions.\nPulls on liquidity accelerate cash outflows. Examples include paying vendors sooner\nthan is optimal and changes in credit terms that require repayment of outstanding\nbalances.\n"}
