{"id": 852, "text": "3. Composite construction. Creation of meaningful, asset-weighted composites is\nimportant to achieve a fair presentation. Composite performance is based on the\nperformance of one or more portfolios that have the same investment strategy or\ninvestment objective. Composite returns are the asset-weighted average (not a simple\naverage) of the returns on the portfolios that are included in each composite.\n4. Disclosures. The firm must disclose information about the presentation and the\npolicies adopted by the firm so that the raw numbers presented in the report are\nunderstandable to the user. There are some disclosures that all firms must make, but\nsome disclosures may not apply to all firms. If a disclosure is not applicable to a specific\nfirm, the firm is not required to include any statement regarding it.\n"}
