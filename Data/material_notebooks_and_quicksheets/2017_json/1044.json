{"id": 1044, "text": "Short-term interest rates are determined by the equilibrium between money supply and\nmoney demand. As illustrated in Figure 1, if the interest rate is above the equilibrium\nrate (ihigh), there is excess supply of real money. Firms and households are holding\nmore real money balances than they desire to, given the opportunity cost of holding\nmoney balances. They will purchase securities to reduce their money balances, which\nwill decrease the interest rate as securities prices are bid up. If interest rates are below\nequilibrium (iLow), there is excess demand for real money balances, as illustrated in\nFigure 1. Firms and households will sell securities to increase their money holdings to\nthe desired level, decreasing securities prices and increasing the interest rate.\n"}
