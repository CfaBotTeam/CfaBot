{"id": 1080, "text": "Monetary policy is often adjusted to reflect the source of inflation. For example, if\ninflation is above target due to higher aggregate demand (consumer and business\nspending), then contractionary monetary policy may be an appropriate response to\nreduce inflation. Suppose, however, that inflation is higher due to supply shocks,\nsuch as higher food or energy prices, and the economy is already operating below full\nemployment. In such a situation, a contractionary monetary policy may make a bad\nsituation worse.\n"}
