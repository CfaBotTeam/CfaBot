This can be done\nusing trial and error or by using the IRR function on a financial calculator or\nspreadsheet.\nThe intuition here is that we deposited $100 into the account at t = 0, then added $118\nto the account at t = 1 (which, with the $2 dividend, funded the purchase of one more\nshare at $120), and ended with a total value of $264.\n"}
