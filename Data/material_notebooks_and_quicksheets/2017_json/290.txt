{"id": 290, "text": "Professor's Note: The combination formula \u201eC, and the permutation formula\n\u201eP, are both available on the TI calculator. To calculate the number of different\ngroups of three stocks from a list of eight stocks (i.e., gCZ, the sequence is\n8 [2nd] (\u201eCJ 3 (=), which yields 56. If we want to know the number of\ndifferently ordered groups of three that can be selected from a list of eight, we\nenter 8 (2nd] IPJ 3 (=] to get 336, which is the number of permutations,\n8!. This function is not available on the HP calculator. Remember,\n(8 \u2013 3)!\ncurrent policy permits you to bring both calculators to the exam if you choose.\n"}
