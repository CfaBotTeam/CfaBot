{"id": 613, "text": "An F-distribution is presented in Figure 9. As indicated, the F-distribution is rightskewed and is truncated at zero on the left-hand side. The shape of the F-distribution\nis determined by two separate degrees of freedom, the numerator degrees of freedom, df,,\nand the denominator degrees of freedom, df,. Also shown in Figure 9 is that the rejection\nregion is in the right-side tail of the distribution. This will always be the case as long\nas the F-statistic is computed with the largest sample variance in the numerator. The\nlabeling of 1 and 2 is arbitrary anyway.\n"}
