{"id": "2532", "text": "The benefits of a well-functioning financial system are tremendous. Savers can fund\nentrepreneurs who need capital to fund new companies. Company risks can be\nshared so that risky companies can be funded. These benefits are enhanced because\nthe transactions can occur among strangers, widening the opportunities for capital\nformation and risk sharing in the economy.\nFurthermore, in informationally efficiently markets, capital is allocated to its most\nproductive use. That is, they are allocationally efficient. Informational efficiency is\nbrought about by traders who bid prices up and down in response to new information\nthat changes estimates of securities' fundamental values. If markets are operationally\nefficient, security prices will be more informationally efficient because low trading costs\nencourage trading based on new information. The existence of accounting standards\nand financial reporting requirements also reduces the costs of obtaining information and\nincreases security values.\n"}
