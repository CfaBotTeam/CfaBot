{"id": "3744", "text": "The coupon bond values we have calculated so far are calculated one period before the\nnext coupon payment will be made. For most bond trades, the settlement date, which is\nwhen cash is exchanged for the bond, will fall between coupon payment dates. As time\npasses (and future coupon payment dates get closer), the value of the bond will increase.\nConsider a bond with a 5% coupon that has a 5% yield-to-maturity. Just after each\ncoupon is paid, the bond value will be its par value. As time passes and the future\npayment dates get closer, the bond's value will increase. The rate of increase in the\nbond's value is equal to the bond's YTM so that the value of this bond between coupon\npayment dates is par x (1+ YTM)/T, where t is the number of days from the last coupon\npayment date until the date the bond trade will settle, and T is the number of days\n"}
