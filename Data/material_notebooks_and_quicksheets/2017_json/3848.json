{"id": 3848, "text": "Fred has 50,000 auto loans totaling $1 billion that it would like to remove from its\nbalance sheet and use the proceeds to make more auto loans. It accomplishes this by\nselling the loan portfolio to a special purpose entity (SPE) called Auto Loan Trust for\n$1 billion (Fred is called the seller). The SPE, which is set up for the specific purpose\nof buying these auto loans and selling asset-backed securities (ABS), is referred to as\nthe trust or the issuer. The SPE then sells ABS to investors. The loan portfolio is the\ncollateral supporting the ABS because the cash flows from the loans are the source of the\nfunds to make the promised payments to investors. An SPE is sometimes also called a\nspecial purpose vehicle (SPV). The SPE is a separate legal entity from Fred.\nLet's review the parties to this transaction and their functions:\n\u2022 The seller (Fred) originates the auto loans and sells the portfolio of loans to Auto\nLoan Trust, the SPE.\nThe issuer/trust (Auto Loan Trust) is the SPE that buys the loans from the seller and\nissues ABS to investors.\nThe servicer (Fred) services the loans.\nIn this case, the seller and the servicer are the same entity (Fred Motor Company),\nbut that is not always the case.\nThe structure of this securitization transaction is illustrated in Figure 1.\n"}
