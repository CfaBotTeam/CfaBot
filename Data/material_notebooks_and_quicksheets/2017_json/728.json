{"id": 728, "text": "Hypothesis Testing - Two-Tailed Test Example\nUsing the same assumptions as before, suppose that the analyst now wants to determine\nif he can say with 99% confidence that the stock's return is not equal to 0.0 percent.\nH.: p = 0.0%, H: u = 0.0%. The test statistic (z-value) = (2.0 \u2013 0.0) / (20.0 / 6) = 0.60.\nThe significance level = 1.0 \u2013 0.99 = 0.01, or 1%. Because we are interested in whether\nor not the stock return is nonzero, this is a two-tailed test.\nUsing the Cumulative Z-Table\nBecause this is a two-tailed test with an alpha of 0.01, there is a 0.005 rejection region\nin both tails. Thus, we need to find the value 0.995 (1.0 \u2013 0.005) in the table. The\nclosest value is 0.9951, which corresponds to a critical z-value of 2.58. Because the test\nstatistic is less than the critical value, we fail to reject H, and conclude that the stock's\nreturn equals 0.0 percent.\n"}
