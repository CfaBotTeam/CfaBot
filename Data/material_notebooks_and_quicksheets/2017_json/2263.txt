{"id": 2263, "text": "An investor's utility function represents the investor's preferences in terms of risk and\nreturn (i.e., his degree of risk aversion). An indifference curve is a tool from economics\nthat, in this application, plots combinations of risk (standard deviation) and expected\nreturn among which an investor is indifferent. In constructing indifference curves for\nportfolios based on only their expected return and standard deviation of returns, we\nare assuming that these are the only portfolio characteristics that investors care about.\nIn Figure 4, we show three indifference curves for an investor. The investor's expected\nutility is the same for all points along a single indifference curve. Indifference curve I,\nrepresents the most preferred portfolios in Figure 4; our investor will prefer any portfolio\nalong I, to any portfolio on either I, or Iz.\n"}
