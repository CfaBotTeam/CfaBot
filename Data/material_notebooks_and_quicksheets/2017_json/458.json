{"id": "458", "text": "Regardless of whether we are concerned with point estimates or confidence intervals,\nthere are certain statistical properties that make some estimates more desirable than\nothers. These desirable properties of an estimator are unbiasedness, efficiency, and\nconsistency.\nAn unbiased estimator is one for which the expected value of the estimator is equal\nto the parameter you are trying to estimate. For example, because the expected value\nof the sample mean is equal to the population mean (E(x)=p), the sample mean is\nan unbiased estimator of the population mean.\nAn unbiased estimator is also efficient if the variance of its sampling distribution is\nsmaller than all the other unbiased estimators of the parameter you are trying to\nestimate. The sample mean, for example, is an unbiased and efficient estimator of\nthe population mean.\nA consistent estimator is one for which the accuracy of the parameter estimate\nincreases as the sample size increases. As the sample size increases, the standard error\nof the sample mean falls, and the sampling distribution bunches more closely around\nthe population mean. In fact, as the sample size approaches infinity, the standard\nerror approaches zero.\nLOS 11.h: Distinguish between a point estimate and a confidence interval\nestimate of a population parameter.\n"}
