{"id": "1377", "text": "One such game is called the prisoner's dilemma. Two prisoners, A and B, are believed to\nhave committed a serious crime. However, the prosecutor does not feel that the police\nhave sufficient evidence for a conviction. The prisoners are separated and offered the\nfollowing deal:\nIf Prisoner A confesses and Prisoner B remains silent, Prisoner A goes free and\nPrisoner B receives a 10-year prison sentence.\nIf Prisoner B confesses and Prisoner A remains silent, Prisoner B goes free and\nPrisoner A receives a 10-year prison sentence.\nIf both prisoners remain silent, each will receive a 6-month sentence.\nIf both prisoners confess, each will receive a 2-year sentence.\nEach prisoner must choose either to betray the other by confessing or to remain silent.\nNeither prisoner, however, knows for sure what the other prisoner will choose to do. The\nresult for each of these four possible outcomes is presented in Figure 14.\nFigure 14: Prisoner's Dilemma\nPrisoner Bis silent\nPrisoner B confesses\nA gets 6 months\nA gets 10 years\nPrisoner A is silent\nB gets 6 months\nB goes free\nA goes free\nA gets 2 years\nPrisoner A confesses\nB gets 10 years\nB gets 2 years\n"}
