{"id": 2735, "text": "A thorough industry analysis should include the following elements:\nEvaluate the relationships between macroeconomic variables and industry trends\nusing information from industry groups, firms in the industry, competitors,\nsuppliers, and customers.\nEstimate industry variables using different approaches and scenarios.\nCompare with other analysts' forecasts of industry variables to confirm the validity\nof the analysis and potentially find industries that are misvalued as a result of\nconsensus forecasts.\nDetermine the relative valuation of different industries.\nCompare the valuations of industries across time to determine the volatility of their\nperformance over the long run and during different phases of the business cycle.\nThis is useful for long-term investing as well as short-term industry rotation based\non the current economic environment.\nAnalyze industry prospects based on strategic groups, which are groups of firms that\nare distinct from the rest of the industry due to the delivery or complexity of their\nproducts or barriers to entry. For example, full-service hotels are a distinct market\nsegment within the hotel industry.\nClassify industries by life-cycle stage, whether it is embryonic, growth, shakeout,\nmature, or declining.\nPosition the industry on the experience curve, which shows the cost per unit relative\nto output. The curve declines because of increases in productivity and economies of\nscale, especially in industries with high fixed costs.\nConsider the forces that affect industries, which include demographic,\nmacroeconomic, governmental, social, and technological influences.\nExamine the forces that determine competition within an industry.\n"}
