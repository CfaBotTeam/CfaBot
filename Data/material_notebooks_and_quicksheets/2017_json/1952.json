{"id": 1952, "text": "To convert to FIFO gross profit margin, the $10 change in the LIFO reserve is\nsubtracted from LIFO COGS. Thus, under FIFO, gross profit margin is ($1,000 +\n$10 change in LIFO reserve) / $4,000 = 25.3%. Gross profit margin is higher under\nFIFO because COGS is lower under FIFO.\n"}
