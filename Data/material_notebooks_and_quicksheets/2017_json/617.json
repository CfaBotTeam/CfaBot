{"id": 617, "text": "State the decision rule regarding the hypothesis. Using the sample sizes for the two\nindustries, the critical F-value for our test is found to be 1.74. This value is obtained\nfrom the table of the F-distribution at the 5% level of significance with df, = 30 and\ndf, = 40. Thus, if the computed F-statistic is greater than the critical value of 1.74,\nthe null hypothesis is rejected. The decision rule, illustrated in the figure below, can be\nstated as:\n"}
