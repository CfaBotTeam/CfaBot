Advances in communications, especially through internet outlets and social\nmedia sites, have levelled the playing fields to a significant degree. It has become much\neasier for dissident shareholders to bring issues to the attention of other shareholders\nand to influence public opinion about certain issues. Among senior managers and\nboard members, concern about their professional reputations has increased as a result.\nMedia exposure can act as an important incentive for management to pursue policies\nthat are consistent with the interests of shareholders and avoid egregious related-party\ntransactions.\n"}
