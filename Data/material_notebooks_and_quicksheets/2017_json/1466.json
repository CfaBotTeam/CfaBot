{"id": "1466", "text": "In Panel (a) of Figure 6, Point A is on an LM curve for a lower real money supply (and\ntherefore a higher price level) than Point B. Point C is on an LM curve for a higher\nreal money supply (and therefore a lower price level) then Point B. As a result, the\nrelationship between the price level and real income, given that income is equal to\nplanned expenditures (the IS curve) and money demand is equal to money supply (the\nLM curve), must be downward sloping. This is the aggregate demand curve [Panel (b) in\nFigure 6).\n"}
