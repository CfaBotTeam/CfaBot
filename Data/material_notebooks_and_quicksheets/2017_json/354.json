{"id": 354, "text": "Expected Value and Variance of a Binomial Random Variable\nFor a given series of n trials, the expected number of successes, or E(X), is given by the\nfollowing formula:\nexpected value of X = E(X) = np\nThe intuition is straightforward; if we perform n trials and the probability of success on\neach trial is p, we expect np successes.\nThe variance of a binomial random variable is given by:\n"}
