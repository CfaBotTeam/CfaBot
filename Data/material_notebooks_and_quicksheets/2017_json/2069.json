{"id": "2069", "text": "Before we look at the calculations involved in determining the effect of a share\nrepurchase on EPS, consider the following intuitive approach. The earnings yield for\na share of stock is simply EPS divided by the share price. A $20 stock with EPS of $1\nhas an earnings yield of 5%. If the after-tax yield on company funds used to repurchase\nshares, or the after-tax cost of borrowed funds used to repurchase shares, is greater than\n5%, EPS will fall as a result of the repurchase. If the after-tax yield on company funds\nused to repurchase shares, or the after-tax cost of borrowed funds used to repurchase\nshares, is less than 5%, EPS will rise as a result of the repurchase.\n"}
