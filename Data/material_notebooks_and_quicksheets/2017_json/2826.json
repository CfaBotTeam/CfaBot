{"id": "2826", "text": "A critique of price multiples is that they reflect only the past because historical (trailing)\ndata are often used in the denominator. For this reason, many practitioners use forward\n(leading or prospective) values in the denominator (sales, book value, earnings, etc.).\nThe use of projected values can result in much different ratios. An analyst should be sure\nto use price multiple calculations consistently across firms.\n"}
