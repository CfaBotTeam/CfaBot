{"id": 3208, "text": "For an investment horizon equal to the bond's Macaulay duration of 6, the horizon\nreturn is equal to the original YTM of 10.5%. For a shorter three-year investment\nhorizon, the price increase from a reduction in the YTM to 9.5% dominates the\ndecrease in reinvestment income so the horizon return, 11.520%, is greater than the\noriginal YTM. For an investor who holds the bond to maturity, there is no price effect\nand the decrease in reinvestment income reduces the horizon return to 10.253%, less\nthan the original YTM.\n"}
