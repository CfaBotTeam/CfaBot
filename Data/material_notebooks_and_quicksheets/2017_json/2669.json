{"id": 2669, "text": "Preferred shares have a stated par value and pay a percentage dividend based on the par\nvalue of the shares. An $80 par value preferred with a 10% dividend pays a dividend of\n$8 per year. Investors in participating preference shares receive extra dividends if firm\nprofits exceed a predetermined level and may receive a value greater than the par value\nof the preferred stock if the firm is liquidated. Non-participating preference shares have\na claim equal to par value in the event of liquidation and do not share in firm profits.\nSmaller and riskier firms whose investors may be concerned about the firm's future often\nissue participating preferred stock so investors can share in the upside potential of the\nfirm.\n"}
