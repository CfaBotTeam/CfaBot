With no initial change in aggregate supply, output increases to GDP,\nand the price level increases to Pr. Prices rise, and real GDP is above potential (fullemployment) GDP.\nWith real GDP above its full-employment level, the increase in GDP is not sustainable.\nUnemployment falls below its natural rate, which puts upward pressure on real wages.\nRising real wages result in a decrease in short-run aggregate supply (the curve shifts left\nto SRASI) until real GDP reverts back to full-employment GDP. Output falls back to\nGDP*, and the price level increases further to Pz.\n"}
