{"id": 36, "text": "The internal rate of return (IRR) is defined as the rate of return that equates the\nPV of an investment's expected benefits (inflows) with the PV of its costs (outflows).\nEquivalently, the IRR may be defined as the discount rate for which the NPV of an\ninvestment is zero.\nCalculating IRR requires only that we identify the relevant cash flows for the investment\nopportunity being evaluated. Market-determined discount rates, or any other external\n(market-driven) data, are not necessary with the IRR procedure. The general formula for\nthe IRR is:\n0= CF, + CH_4 CF,\nCFN\nT1+ IRR\" (1+ IRR)2 (1+IRR)N\nIn the majority of IRR applications to capital budgeting, the initial cash flow, CF,\nrepresents the initial cost of the investment opportunity, and is therefore a negative\nvalue. As such, any discount rate less than the IRR will result in a positive NPV, and a\ndiscount rate greater than the IRR will result in a negative NPV. This implies that the\nNPV of an investment is zero when the discount rate used equals the IRR.\nExample: Computing IRR\nWhat is the IRR for the investment described in the preceding example:\n"}
