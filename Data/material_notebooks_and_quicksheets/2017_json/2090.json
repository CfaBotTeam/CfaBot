{"id": "2090", "text": "Some companies tend to have chronically weak liquidity positions, often due to specific\nfactors that affect the company or its industry. These companies typically need to borrow\nagainst their long-lived assets to acquire working capital.\nLiquidity ratios are employed by analysts to determine the firm's ability to pay its shortterm liabilities.\n\u2022 The current ratio is the best-known measure of liquidity:\ncurrent assets\ncurrent ratio =\ncurrent liabilities\nThe higher the current ratio, the more likely it is that the company will be able to\npay its short-term bills. A current ratio of less than one means that the company has\nnegative working capital and is probably facing a liquidity crisis. Working capital\nequals current assets minus current liabilities.\nThe quick ratio or acid-test ratio is a more stringent measure of liquidity because it\ndoes not include inventories and other assets that might not be very liquid:\naniel Patin_cash + short-term marketable securities + receivables\ncurrent liabilities\nThe higher the quick ratio, the more likely it is that the company will be able to pay\nits short-term bills.\nThe current and quick ratios differ only in the assumed liquidity of the current\nassets that the analyst projects will be used to pay off current liabilities.\nA measure of accounts receivable liquidity is the receivables turnover:\nreceivables turnover =\ncredit sales\naverage receivables\nIt is considered desirable to have a receivables turnover figure close to the industry\n"}
