{"id": 2501, "text": "Validity Instructions\nValidity instructions specify when an order should be executed. Most orders are day\norders, meaning they expire if unfilled by the end of the trading day. Good-till-cancelled\norders last until they are filled. Immediate-or-cancel orders are cancelled unless they can\nbe filled immediately. They are also known as fill-or-kill orders. Good-on-close orders\nare only filled at the end of the trading day. If they are market orders, they are referred to\nas market-on-close orders. These are often used by mutual funds because their portfolios\nare valued using closing prices. There are also good-on-open orders.\n"}
