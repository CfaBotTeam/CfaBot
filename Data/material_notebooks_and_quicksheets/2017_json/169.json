{"id": 169, "text": "Each of the four possible ending wealth values has a 25% probability, so the expected\nending wealth is simply (4,000 + 1,000 + 1,000 + 250)/4 = $1,562.50, or 0.25(4,000)\n+ 0.50(1,000) + 0.25(250) = $1,562.50. This is consistent with earning a compound\nannual rate of return equal to the arithmetic mean of 25%, 1.252 x $1,000 = $1,562.50,\nbut not with earning the geometric mean return of 0%. For each single year, the\nexpected rate of return is simply the average of +100% and -50% since those outcomes\nare equally likely.\n"}
