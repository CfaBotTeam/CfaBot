This is\nthe essence of the capital budgeting decision. Because a firm's WACC reflects the average\nrisk of the projects that make up the firm, it is not appropriate for evaluating all new\nprojects. It should be adjusted upward for projects with greater-than-average risk and\ndownward for projects with less-than-average risk.\n"}
