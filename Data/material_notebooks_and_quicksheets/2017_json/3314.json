An issue's yield spread to its\nbenchmark includes its credit spread and liquidity premium.\nThe level and volatility of yield spreads are affected by the credit and business cycles,\nthe performance of financial markets as a whole, availability of capital from brokerdealers, and supply and demand for debt issues. Yield spreads tend to narrow when\nthe credit cycle is improving, the economy is expanding, and financial markets and\ninvestor demand for new debt issues are strong. Yield spreads tend to widen when the\ncredit cycle, the economy, and financial markets are weakening, and in periods when\nthe supply of new debt issues is heavy or broker-dealer capital is insufficient for market\nmaking.\n"}
