{"id": 463, "text": "The t-distribution is a symmetrical distribution that is centered about zero. The shape\nof the t-distribution is dependent on the number of degrees of freedom, and degrees\nof freedom are based on the number of sample observations. The t-distribution is\nlatter and has thicker tails than the standard normal distribution. As the number of\nobservations increases (i.e., the degrees of freedom increase), the t-distribution becomes\nmore spiked and its tails become thinner. As the number of degrees of freedom increases\nwithout bound, the t-distribution converges to the standard normal distribution\n(z-distribution). The thickness of the tails relative to those of the z-distribution is\nimportant in hypothesis testing because thicker tails mean more observations away\nfrom the center of the distribution (more outliers). Hence, hypothesis testing using the\nt-distribution makes it more difficult to reject the null relative to hypothesis testing\nusing the z-distribution.\nThe table in Figure 1 contains one-tailed critical values for the t-distribution at the 0.05\nand 0.025 levels of significance with various degrees of freedom (df). Note that, unlike\nthe z-table, the t-values are contained within the table, and the probabilities are located\nat the column headings. Also note that the level of significance of a t-test corresponds to\nthe one-tailed probabilities, p, that head the columns in the t-table.\nFigure 2 illustrates the different shapes of the t-distribution associated with different\ndegrees of freedom. The tendency is for the t-distribution to look more and more like\nthe normal distribution as the degrees of freedom increase. Practically speaking, the\ngreater the degrees of freedom, the greater the percentage of observations near the center\nof the distribution and the lower the percentage of observations in the tails, which\nare thinner as degrees of freedom increase. This means that confidence intervals for a\nrandom variable that follows a t-distribution must be wider (narrower) when the degrees\nof freedom are less (more) for a given significance level.\n"}
