A The writedown in inventory value from cost to net realizable value is reported on the\nincome statement either as an addition to cost of sales or as a separate line item, not\nas other comprehensive income. Depreciation will not be affected as inventory is not\ndepreciated.\n13. B Compared to using LIFO, using average cost would produce lower COGS, higher gross\noperating income, and higher ending inventory, so current assets and the current ratio\nwould be higher. Consequently, gross margin would be higher and asset turnover would\nbe lower under the average cost inventory method.\n14. C When prices are falling, LIFO would result in lower COGS (higher gross profit) and\nhigher ending inventory than FIFO. Higher gross profit with LIFO would result in\nhigher taxes payable which would reduce cash balances (as long they pay their taxes).\n"}
