{"id": "3423", "text": "5. Time to expiration. Because volatility is expressed per unit of time, longer time to\nexpiration effectively increases expected volatility and increases the value of a call\noption. Less time to expiration decreases the time value of a call option so that at\nexpiration it value is simply its intrinsic value.\nFor most put options, longer time to expiration will increase option values for the\nsame reasons. For some European put options, however, extending the time to\nexpiration can decrease the value of the put. In general, the deeper a put option\nis in the money, the higher the risk-free rate, and the longer the current time to\nexpiration, the more likely that extending the option's time to expiration will\ndecrease its value.\n"}
