{"id": 2085, "text": "A company's primary sources of liquidity are the sources of cash it uses in its normal\nday-to-day operations. The company's cash balances result from selling goods and\nservices, collecting receivables, and generating cash from other sources such as\nshort-term investments. Typical sources of short-term funding include trade credit\nfrom vendors and lines of credit from banks. Effective cash flow management of a firm's\ncollections and payments can also be a source of liquidity for a company.\nSecondary sources of liquidity include liquidating short-term or long-lived assets,\nnegotiating debt agreements (i.e., renegotiating), or filing for bankruptcy and\nreorganizing the company. While using its primary sources of liquidity is unlikely to\nchange the company's normal operations, resorting to secondary sources of liquidity\nsuch as these can change the company's financial structure and operations significantly\nand may indicate that its financial position is deteriorating.\n"}
