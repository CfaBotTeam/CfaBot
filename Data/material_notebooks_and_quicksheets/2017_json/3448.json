{"id": "3448", "text": "Floating-Rate Notes\nSome bonds pay periodic interest that depends on a current market rate of interest.\nThese bonds are called floating-rate notes (FRN) or floaters. The market rate of interest\nis called the reference rate, and an FRN promises to pay the reference rate plus some\ninterest margin. This added margin is typically expressed in basis points, which are\nhundredths of 1%. A 120 basis point margin is equivalent to 1.2%.\nAs an example, consider a floating-rate note that pays the London Interbank Offer Rate\n(Libor) plus a margin of 0.75% (75 basis points) annually. If 1-year Libor is 2.3% at the\nbeginning of the year, the bond will pay 2.3% + 0.75% = 3.05% of its par value at the\nend of the year. The new 1-year rate at that time will determine the rate of interest paid\nat the end of the next year. Most floaters pay quarterly and are based on a quarterly (90day) reference rate. A variable-rate note is one for which the margin above the reference\nrate is not fixed.\nA floating-rate note may have a cap, which benefits the issuer by placing a limit on\nhow high the coupon rate can rise. Often, FRNs with caps also have a floor, which\nbenefits the bondholder by placing a minimum on the coupon rate (regardless of how\nlow the reference rate falls). An inverse floater has a coupon rate that increases when the\nreference rate decreases and decreases when the reference rate increases.\n"}
