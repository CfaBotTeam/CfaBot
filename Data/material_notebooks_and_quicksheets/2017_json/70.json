{"id": "70", "text": "Money market to holding period yield\u2013Fmm is an annualized yield based on a\n360-day year. To change the rmm in this example into its HPY, we need to convert it\nto a 150-day holding period by multiplying it by (150 / 360). Thus:\nHPY = TMM * (150 / 360)\n= 0.04898 x (150 / 360)\n= 0.02041 = 2.041%\nHolding period yield to effective annual yield\u2014the EAY is equal to the annualized\nHPY based on a 365-day year. Now that we have computed the HPY, simply\nannualize using a 365-day year to calculate the EAY as follows:\nEAY = (1 + 0.02041)365 / 150 -1\n= 1.05039 \u2013 1 = 5.039%\nNote that to convert the EAY back into the HPY, apply the reciprocal of the exponent\nto the EAY. This is the same as taking one plus the EAY to the power (t/365). For\nexample, we can convert the EAY we just calculated back to the HPY as follows:\n"}
