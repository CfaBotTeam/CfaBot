{"id": 2158, "text": "A great variety of stock mutual funds are available to investors. Index funds are\npassively managed; that is, the portfolio is constructed to match the performance of a\nparticular index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Actively managed funds refer\nto funds where the management selects individual securities with the goal of producing\nreturns greater than those of their benchmark indexes. Annual management fees are\nhigher for actively managed funds, and actively managed funds have higher turnover of\nportfolio securities (the percentage of investments that are changed during the year). This\nleads to greater tax liabilities compared to passively managed index funds.\n"}
