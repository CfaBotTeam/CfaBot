{"id": "689", "text": "Indicators can include opinion polls that try to measure investor sentiment directly, as\nwell as several measures that are based on market data:\n\u2022 Put/call ratio. Put options increase in value when the price of an underlying asset\ndecreases, while call options increase in value if the price of the underlying asset\nincreases. For financial assets that have actively traded options, the volume of put\nand call options reflects activity by investors with negative and positive outlooks,\nrespectively, about the asset. The put/ call ratio is put volume divided by call volume.\nIncreases in the put/ call ratio indicate a more negative outlook for the price of the\nasset. This ratio is generally viewed as a contrarian indicator. Extremely high ratios\nindicate strongly bearish investor sentiment and possibly an oversold market, while\nextremely low ratios indicate strongly bullish sentiment and perhaps an overbought\nmarket.\nVolatility Index (VIX). The Chicago Board Options Exchange calculates the VIX,\nwhich measures the volatility of options on the S&P 500 stock index. High levels\nof the VIX suggest investors fear declines in the stock market. Technical analysts\nmost often interpret the VIX in a contrarian way, viewing a predominantly bearish\ninvestor outlook as a bullish sign.\n"}
