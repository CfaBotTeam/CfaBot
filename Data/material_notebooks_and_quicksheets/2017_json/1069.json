If a government with large debts, instead of a central bank, set an\ninflation target, the target would not be credible because the government has an\nincentive to allow inflation to exceed the target level. On the other hand, a credible\ncentral bank's targets can become self-fulfilling prophecies. If the market believes\nthat a central bank is serious about achieving a target inflation rate of 3%, wages and\nother nominal contracts will be based on 3% inflation, and actual inflation will then\nbe close to that level.\n"}
