{"id": 2622, "text": "1. Weak-form market efficiency. The weak form of the efficient markets hypothesis\n(EMH) states that current security prices fully reflect all currently available security\nmarket data. Thus, past price and volume (market) information will have no\npredictive power about the future direction of security prices because price changes\nwill be independent from one period to the next. In a weak-form efficient market, an\ninvestor cannot achieve positive risk-adjusted returns on average by using technical\nanalysis.\n2. Semi-strong form market efficiency. The semi-strong form of the EMH holds that\nsecurity prices rapidly adjust without bias to the arrival of all new public information.\nAs such, current security prices fully reflect all publicly available information. The\nsemi-strong form says security prices include all past security market information and\nnonmarket information available to the public. The implication is that an investor\ncannot achieve positive risk-adjusted returns on average by using fundamental analysis.\n3. Strong-form market efficiency. The strong form of the EMH states that security\nprices fully reflect all information from both public and private sources. The strong form\nincludes all types of information: past security market information, public, and\nprivate (inside) information. This means that no group of investors has monopolistic\naccess to information relevant to the formation of prices, and none should be able to\nconsistently achieve positive abnormal returns.\n"}
