{"id": "2910", "text": "Independent vs. Mutually Exclusive Projects\nIndependent projects are projects that are unrelated to each other and allow for each\nproject to be evaluated based on its own profitability. For example, if projects A and\nB are independent, and both projects are profitable, then the firm could accept both\nprojects. Mutually exclusive means that only one project in a set of possible projects\ncan be accepted and that the projects compete with each other. If projects A and B\nwere mutually exclusive, the firm could accept either Project A or Project B, but not\nboth. A capital budgeting decision between two different stamping machines with\ndifferent costs and output would be an example of choosing between two mutually\nexclusive projects.\n"}
