{"id": "2335", "text": "Comparing the CML and the SML\nIt is important to recognize that the CML and SML are very different. Recall the\nequation of the CML:\n[[E(RM) \u2013 Re]]\nE(Rp) = R +op\nOM\nThe CML uses total risk = 0, on the x-axis. Hence, only efficient portfolios will plot on\nthe CML. On the other hand, the SML uses beta (systematic risk) on the x-axis. So in a\nCAPM world, all properly priced securities and portfolios of securities will plot on the SML,\nas shown in Figure 9.\nFigure 9: Comparing the CML and the SML\n(a) Capital Market Line\nE(R)\n"}
