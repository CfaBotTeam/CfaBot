{"id": "2432", "text": "Risk management. Entities face risks from changing interest rates, currency values,\ncommodities values, and defaults on debt, among other things. For example, a firm\nthat owes a foreign currency in 90 days can lock in the price of this foreign currency\nin domestic currency units by entering into a forward contract. Future delivery of the\nforeign currency is guaranteed at a domestic-currency price set at inception of the\ncontract. In this transaction, the firm would be referred to as a hedger. This hedging\nallows the firm to enter a market that it would otherwise be reluctant to enter by\nreducing the risk of the transaction. Hedging instruments are available from exchanges,\ninvestment banks, insurance firms, and other institutions.\nExchanging assets. The financial system also allows entities to exchange assets. For\nexample, Proctor and Gamble may sell soap in Europe but have costs denominated in\nU.S. dollars. Proctor and Gamble can exchange their euros from soap sales for dollars in\nthe currency markets.\n"}
