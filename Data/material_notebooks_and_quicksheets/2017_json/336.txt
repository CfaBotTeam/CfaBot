{"id": 336, "text": "A discrete random variable is one for which the number of possible outcomes can be\ncounted, and for each possible outcome, there is a measurable and positive probability.\nAn example of a discrete random variable is the number of days it rains in a given\nmonth, because there is a finite number of possible outcomes\u2014the number of days it\ncan rain in a month is defined by the number of days in the month.\nA probability function, denoted p(x), specifies the probability that a random variable is\nequal to a specific value. More formally, p(x) is the probability that random variable X\ntakes on the value x, or p(x) = P(X = x).\n"}
