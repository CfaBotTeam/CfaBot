{"id": 2193, "text": "Value at risk (Var) is the minimum loss over a period that will occur with a specific\nprobability. Consider a bank that has a one-week Var of 200 million euros with a\nprobability of 3%. That means that a one-week loss of at least 200 million euros is\nexpected to occur 3% of the time. Note that this is not the maximum one-week loss the\nbank will experience; it is the minimum loss that will occur 3% of the time. Var does\nnot provide a maximum loss for a period. Var has become accepted as a risk measure for\nbanks and is used in establishing minimum capital requirements.\nThere are various methods of calculating Var, and both the inputs and models used will\naffect the calculated value, perhaps significantly. As is always the case with estimates of\nrisk, incorrect inputs or inappropriate distribution assumptions will lead to misleading\nresults. Given these limitations, VaR should be used in conjunction with other risk\nmeasures.\n"}
