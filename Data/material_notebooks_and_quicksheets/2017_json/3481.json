{"id": "3481", "text": "Put Option Profits and Losses\nTo examine the profits/losses associated with trading put options, consider a put option\nwith a $5 premium. The buyer pays $5 to the writer. When the price of the stock at\nexpiration is greater than or equal to the $50 strike price, the put has zero value. The\nbuyer of the option has a loss of $5, and the writer of the option has a gain of $5. As\nthe stock's price falls below $50, the buyer of the put option starts to gain (breakeven\nwill come at $45, when the value of the stock equals the strike price less the option\npremium). However, as the price of the stock moves downward, the seller of the option\nstarts to lose (negative profits will start at $45, when the value of the stock equals the\nstrike price less the option premium).\n"}
