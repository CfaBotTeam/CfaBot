{"id": 1461, "text": "Lower interest rates tend to decrease savings (in favor of current consumption) and\ntend to increase investment by firms because more investments will have positive NPVs\nwhen firms' cost of capital is lower. Therefore, a decrease in interest rates decreases S - I,\nso that (S \u2013 I) < (G - T) + (X - M). In order to satisfy this fundamental relationship,\nincome must increase. Greater income can restore equilibrium in the goods market by\nincreasing savings (which increases S \u2013 I), increasing tax receipts (which decreases\nG-T), and increasing imports (which decreases X - M).\n"}
