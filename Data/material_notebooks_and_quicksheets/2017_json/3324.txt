{"id": 3324, "text": "In some countries, especially European countries, financial companies issue covered\nbonds. Covered bonds are similar to asset-backed securities, but the underlying assets\n(the cover pool), although segregated, remain on the balance sheet of the issuing\ncorporation (i.e., no SPE is created). Special legislation protects the assets in the cover\npool in the event of firm insolvency (they are bankruptcy remote). In contrast to an\nSPE structure, covered bonds also provide recourse to the issuing firm that must replace\nor augment non-performing assets in the cover pool so that it always provides for the\npayment of the covered bond's promised interest and principal payments.\n"}
