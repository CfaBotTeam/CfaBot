C The substitution effect of a price decrease is always positive, but the income effect can\nbe either positive or negative. Consumption of a good will decrease when the price\nof that good decreases only if the income effect is both negative and greater than the\nsubstitution effect.\n4. A An inferior good is one that has a negative income elasticity of demand.\n5. C If a firm is generating sufficient revenue to cover its variable costs and part of its fixed\ncosts, it should continue to operate in the short run. If average revenue is likely to\nremain below average total costs in the long run, the firm should shut down.\n6. B Increasing long-run average total cost as a result of increasing output demonstrates\ndiseconomies of scale.\n"}
