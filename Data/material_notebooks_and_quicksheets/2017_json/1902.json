As a result, when prices are rising, LIFO COGS will be higher than FIFO\nCOGS. When prices are falling, LIFO COGS will be lower than FIFO COGS.\nBecause LIFO COGS is based on the most recent purchases, LIFO produces a better\napproximation of current cost in the income statement.\nWhen prices are changing, the weighted average cost method will produce values of\nCOGS and ending inventory between those of FIFO and LIFO.\n"}
