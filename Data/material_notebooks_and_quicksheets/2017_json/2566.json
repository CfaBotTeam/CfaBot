{"id": "2566", "text": "An index that uses fundamental weighting uses weights based on firm fundamentals,\nsuch as earnings, dividends, or cash flow. In contrast to market capitalization index\nweights, these weights are unaffected by the share prices of the index stocks (although\nrelated to them over the long term). Fundamental weights can be based on a single\nmeasure or some combination of fundamental measures.\n"}
