Probability Concepts\nThe candidate should be able to:\na. define a random variable, an outcome, an event, mutually exclusive events, and\nexhaustive events. (page 159)\nstate the two defining properties of probability and distinguish among empirical,\nsubjective, and a priori probabilities. (page 159)\nstate the probability of an event in terms of odds for and against the event.\n(page 160)\nd. distinguish between unconditional and conditional probabilities. (page 161)\ne. explain the multiplication, addition, and total probability rules. (page 161)\ncalculate and interpret 1) the joint probability of two events, 2) the probability\nthat at least one of two events will occur, given the probability of each and the\njoint probability of the two events, and 3) a joint probability of any number of\nindependent events. (page 161)\ndistinguish between dependent and independent events. (page 165)\ncalculate and interpret an unconditional probability using the total probability\nrule.
