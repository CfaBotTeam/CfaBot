{"id": "3773", "text": "The option-adjusted yield is calculated by adding the value of the call option to the\nbond's current flat price. The value of a callable bond is equal to the value of the bond\nif it did not have the call option, minus the value of the call option (because the issuer\nowns the call option).\nThe option-adjusted yield will be less than the yield-to-maturity for a callable bond\nbecause callable bonds have higher yields to compensate bondholders for the issuer's\ncall option. The option-adjusted yield can be used to compare the yields of bonds with\nvarious embedded options to each other and to similar option-free bonds.\n"}
