{"id": "959", "text": "The first step in this type of problem is to determine the amount of money that\nmust be available at the beginning of Year 4 (t = 3) in order to satisfy the payment\nrequirements. This amount is the PV of a 5-year annuity due at the beginning of Year\n4 (end of Year 3). To determine this amount, set your calculator to the BGN mode,\nenter the relevant data, and compute PV.\nN = 5; I/Y = 10; PMT = -1,000; CPT + PV = PV; = $4,169.87\n"}
