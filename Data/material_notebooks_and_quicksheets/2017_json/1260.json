{"id": "1260", "text": "Elasticities Approach\nThis approach to understanding the impact of exchange rate changes on the balance of\ntrade focuses on how exchange rate changes affect total expenditures on imports and\nexports. Consider an initial situation in which a country has a merchandise trade deficit\n(i.e., its imports exceed its exports). Depreciation of the domestic currency will make\nimports more expensive in domestic currency terms and exports less expensive in foreign\ncurrency terms. Thus, depreciation of the domestic currency will increase exports and\ndecrease imports and would seem to unambiguously reduce the trade deficit. However,\nit is not the quantity of imports and exports, but the total expenditures on imports and\nexports that must change in order to affect the trade deficit. Thus, the elasticity of\ndemand for export goods and import goods is a crucial part of the analysis.\n"}
