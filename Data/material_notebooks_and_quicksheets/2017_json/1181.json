{"id": 1181, "text": "Capital Restrictions\nSome countries impose capital restrictions on the flow of financial capital across\nborders. Restrictions include outright prohibition of investment in the domestic country\nby foreigners, prohibition of or taxes on the income earned on foreign investments by\ndomestic citizens, prohibition of foreign investment in certain domestic industries, and\nrestrictions on repatriation of earnings of foreign entities operating in a country.\nOverall, capital restrictions are thought to decrease economic welfare. However, over the\nshort term, they have helped developing countries avoid the impact of great inflows of\nforeign capital during periods of optimistic expansion and the impact of large outflows\nof foreign capital during periods of correction and market unease or outright panic. Even\nthese short-term benefits may not offset longer-term costs if the country is excluded\nfrom international markets for financial capital flows.\n"}
