{"id": 2182, "text": "We describe the principles of risk management here in a framework that can be applied\nbroadly, not only to firms or organizations in general, but also to the management of\ninvestment portfolios and financial firms, and even to individuals deciding how much\nrisk and which specific risks they will take. Individuals follow a similar approach,\nselecting a bundle of risks that is optimal for maximizing their expected utility (rather\nthan returns or profit).\n"}
