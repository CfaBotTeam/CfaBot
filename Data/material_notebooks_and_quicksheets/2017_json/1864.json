A Company and industry data are widely available from numerous private and public\nsources. The other statements describe limitations of financial ratios.\n3. C Fixed charge coverage is a solvency ratio. Return on total capital is a measure of\nprofitability and the defensive interval ratio is a liquidity measure.\n4. B payables turnover = (purchases / avg. AP) = 100 / 12 = 8.33\npayables payment period = 365 / 8.33 = 43.8 days\n5. B total asset turnover = (sales / total assets) = 150 / 75 = 2 times\ninventory turnover = (COGS / avg. inventory) = (150 \u2013 45) / 15 = 7 times\n6. C receivables turnover = (S / avg. AR) = 100 / 25 = 4\naverage collection period = 365 | 4 = 91.25 days\n7. B Current ratio = (cash + AR + inv) / AP. If cash and AP decrease by the same amount and\nthe current ratio is greater than 1, then the denominator falls faster (in percentage terms)\nthan the numerator, and the current ratio increases.\n8. A Quick ratio = (cash + AR) / AP. If cash decreases, the quick ratio will also decrease. The\ndenominator is unchanged.\n9. c Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities. If CR is > 1, then if CA and CL both\nfall, the overall ratio will increase.\n10. A (365 / 10 + 365 /5 - 365 19) = 69 days\n11. B Interest coverage ratio = EBIT /I = (1,000 \u2013 400 \u2013 300) / 100 = 3 times\n12. C This is the correct formula for the three-ratio DuPont model for ROE.\n"}
