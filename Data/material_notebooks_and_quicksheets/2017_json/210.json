{"id": 210, "text": "There are two defining properties of probability.\n\u2022 The probability of occurrence of any event (E,) is between 0 and 1\n(i.e., 0< P(E) < 1).\nIf a set of events, E, E2, ... E, is mutually exclusive and exhaustive, the\nprobabilities of those events sum to 1 (i.e., EP(E) = 1).\nThe first of the defining properties introduces the term P(E), which is shorthand for the\n\"probability of event i.\u201d IF P(E) = 0, the event will never happen. If P(E) = 1, the event\nis certain to occur, and the outcome is not random.\n"}
