{"id": 1916, "text": "A LIFO liquidation occurs when a LIFO firm's inventory quantities decline. Older,\nlower costs are included in COGS compared to a situation in which inventory quantities\nare not declining. LIFO liquidation results in higher profit margins and higher income\ntaxes compared to what they would be if inventory quantities were not declining. The\nextra profit reported with a LIFO liquidation inflates operating margins by recognizing\nhistorical inflationary gains from increasing inventory prices as income in the current\nperiod. Increases in profit margins from LIFO liquidation are not sustainable, however,\nbecause a firm cannot continue forever to sell existing inventory without replenishment.\n"}
