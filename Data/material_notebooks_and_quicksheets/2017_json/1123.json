{"id": "1123", "text": "3. Expansionary fiscal policy + contractionary monetary policy: In this case, aggregate\ndemand will likely be higher (due to fiscal policy), while interest rates will be higher\n(due to increased government borrowing and tight monetary policy). Government\nspending as a proportion of GDP will increase.\n4. Contractionary fiscal policy + expansionary monetary policy: In this case, interest\nrates will fall from decreased government borrowing and from the expansion of\nthe money supply, increasing both private consumption and output. Government\nspending as a proportion of GDP will decrease due to contractionary fiscal policy.\nThe private sector would grow as a result of lower interest rates.\nNot surprisingly, the fiscal multipliers for different types of fiscal stimulus differ, and the\neffects of expansionary fiscal policy are greater when it is combined with expansionary\nmonetary policy. The fiscal multiplier for direct government spending increases has been\nmuch higher than the fiscal multiplier for increases in transfers to individuals or tax\nreductions for workers. Within this latter category, government transfer payments to the\npoor have the greatest relative impact, followed by tax cuts for workers, and broaderbased transfers to individuals (not targeted). For all types of fiscal stimulus, the impact\nis greater when the fiscal actions are combined with expansionary monetary policy. This\nmay reflect the impact of greater inflation, falling real interest rates, and the resulting\nincrease in business investment.\n"}
