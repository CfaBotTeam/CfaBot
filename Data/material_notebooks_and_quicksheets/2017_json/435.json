The lognormal distribution is skewed to the right, whereas the normal distribution is\nsymmetrical. The lognormal distribution can only have positive values, whereas the\nnormal distribution includes both positive and negative values. This property makes the\nlognormal distribution useful for modeling asset prices.\n"}
