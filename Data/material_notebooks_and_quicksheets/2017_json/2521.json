{"id": "2521", "text": "Order matching rules establish an order precedence hierarchy. Price priority is one\ncriteria, where the trades given highest priority are those at the highest bid (buy) and\nlowest ask (sell). If orders are at the same prices, a secondary precedence rule gives\npriority to non-hidden orders and earliest arriving orders. These rules encourage traders\nto price their trades aggressively, display their entire orders, and trade earlier, thereby\nimproving liquidity.\nAfter orders are created using order matching rules, trade pricing rules are used to\ndetermine the price. Under the uniform pricing rule, all orders trade at the same price,\nwhich is the price that results in the highest volume of trading. The discriminatory\npricing rule uses the limit price of the order that arrived first as the trade price.\n"}
