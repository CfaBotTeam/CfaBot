{"id": "2396", "text": "Tax situation: Besides an individual's overall tax rate, the tax treatment of various types\nof investment accounts is also a consideration in portfolio construction. For a fully\ntaxable account, investors subject to higher tax rates may prefer tax-free bonds (U.S.)\nto taxable bonds or prefer equities that are expected to produce capital gains, which\nare often taxed at a lower rate than other types of income. A focus on expected aftertax returns over time in relation to risk should correctly account for differences in tax\ntreatments as well as investors' overall tax rates.\n"}
