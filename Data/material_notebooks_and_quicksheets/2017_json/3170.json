{"id": "3170", "text": "For bonds with embedded options, the future cash flows depend not only on future\ninterest rates but also on the path that interest rates take over time (did they fall to a new\nlevel or rise to that level?). We must use effective duration to estimate the interest rate\nrisk of these bonds. The effective duration measure must also be based on bond prices\nfrom a pricing model. The fact that bonds with embedded options have uncertain future\ncash flows means that our present value calculations for bond value based on YTM\ncannot be used.\n"}
