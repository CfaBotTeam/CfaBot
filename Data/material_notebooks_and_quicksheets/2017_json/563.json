{"id": "563", "text": "Some examples from the Standards themselves are:\n...use reasonable care and judgment to achieve...\n...accept any gift, that reasonably could be expected to compromise...\n...act with reasonable care and exercise prudent judgment...\n...deal fairly and objectively with all clients...\n...make a reasonable inquiry into...\n...make reasonable efforts to ensure...\n...might reasonably be expected to create a conflict of interest with...\n...Have a reasonable and adequate basis...\n...Use reasonable judgment in...\n...matters that could be reasonably expected to impair...\nThe requirement of the LOS is that you know what constitutes a violation, not that you\ndraw a distinction between what is \u201creasonable\u201d and what is not in a given situation. We\nbelieve the exam writers take this into account and that if they intend, for example, to\ntest whether a recommendation has been given without reasonable care and judgment, it\nwill likely be clear either that the care and judgment exhibited by the analyst did not rise\nto the level of \u201creasonable,\" or that it did.\n"}
