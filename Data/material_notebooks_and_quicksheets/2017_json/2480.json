{"id": 2480, "text": "Short Sales and Positions\nIn a short sale, the short seller (1) simultaneously borrows and sells securities through a\nbroker, (2) must return the securities at the request of the lender or when the short sale\nis closed out, and (3) must keep a portion of the proceeds of the short sale on deposit\nwith the broker. Short sellers hope to profit from a fall in the price of the security or\nasset sold short, buying at a lower price in the future in order to repay the loan of the\nasset originally sold at a higher price. The repayment of the borrowed security or other\nasset is referred to as \"covering the short position.\"\n"}
