{"id": "509", "text": "17. C At the 95% level of significance, with sample size n = 100 and mean 31.5 years, the\nappropriate test statistic is za/2 = 1.96. Note: The mean of 31.5 is calculated as the\nmidpoint of the interval, or (19 + 44)/2. Thus, the confidence interval is 31.5 + 1.96 Sx,\nwhere Sx is the standard error of the sample mean. If we take the upper bound, we\nknow that 31.5 + 1.96 sg = 44, or 1.96 sx = 12.5, or sx = 6.38 years.\n18. C Mutual fund performance studies are most closely associated with survivorship bias\nbecause only the better-performing funds remain in the sample over time.\n19. C Use the t-statistic at a/2 and n - 1 degrees of freedom when the population variance is\nunknown. While the z-statistic is acceptable when the sample size is large, sample size is\nnot given here, and the t-statistic is always appropriate under these conditions.\n20. A When the sample size is large, and the central limit theorem can be relied upon to assure\na sampling distribution that is normal, either the t-statistic or the z-statistic is acceptable\nfor constructing confidence intervals for the population mean. The t-statistic, however,\nwill provide a more conservative range (wider) at a given level of significance.\n"}
