{"id": 478, "text": "Professor's Note: You should practice looking up reliability factors (a.k.a.\ncritical t-values or t-statistics) in a t-table. The first step is always to\ncompute the degrees of freedom, which is n \u2013 1. The second step is to find\nthe appropriate level of alpha or significance. This depends on whether the\ntest you're concerned with is one-tailed (use a) or two-tailed (use a/2). In\nthis review, our tests will always be two-tailed because confidence intervals\nare designed to compute an upper and lower limit. Thus, we will use a/2.\nTo look up t29, 2.5 find the 29 df row and match it with the 0.025 column;\nt = 2.045 is the result. We'll do more of this in our study of hypothesis\ntesting.\n"}
