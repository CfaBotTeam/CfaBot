{"id": "273", "text": "Example: Correlation and covariance\nConsider a portfolio of three assets, X, Y, and Z, where the individual market value\nof these assets is $600, $900, and $1,500, respectively. The market weight, expected\nreturn, and variance for the individual assets are presented below. The correlation\nmatrix for the asset returns are shown in the following figure. Using this information,\ncompute the variance of the portfolio return.\nE(Rx) = 0.10 Var(RX) = 0.0016 wx = 0.2\nE(Ry) = 0.12 Var(Ry) = 0.0036 wy = 0.3\nE(RZ) = 0.16 Var(R2) = 0.0100 wz = 0.5\n"}
