{"id": 2981, "text": "The WACC, as we have described it, is the cost of financing firm assets. We can view\nthis cost as an opportunity cost. Consider how a company could reduce its costs if it\nfound a way to produce its output using fewer assets, like less working capital. If we\nneed less working capital, we can use the funds freed up to buy back our debt and equity\nsecurities in a mix that just matches our target capital structure. Our after-tax savings\nwould be the WACC based on our target capital structure multiplied by the total value\nof the securities that are no longer outstanding.\n"}
