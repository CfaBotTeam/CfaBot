{"id": 2954, "text": "In reality, the impact of a project on the company's stock price is more complicated\nthan the previous example. A company's stock price is a function of the present value\nof its expected future earnings stream. As a result, changes in the stock price will result\nmore from changes in expectations about a firm's positive NPV projects. If a company\nannounces a project for which managers expect a positive NPV but analysts expect a\nlower level of profitability from the project than the company does (e.g., an acquisition),\nthe stock price may actually drop on the announcement. As another example, a project\nannouncement may be taken as a signal about other future capital projects, raising\nexpectations and resulting in a stock price increase that is much greater than what the\nNPV of the announced project would justify.\n"}
