{"id": "1402", "text": "production between two firms and result in a higher average cost of production than\nfor a single producer. Thus, large economies of scale in an industry present significant\nbarriers to entry.\nWe illustrate the case of a natural monopoly in Figure 22. Left unregulated, a singleprice monopolist will maximize profits by producing where MR = MC, producing\nquantity Qiy and charging Py. Given the economies of scale, having another firm in the\nmarket would increase the ATC significantly. Note in Figure 22 that if two firms each\nproduced approximately one-half of output Qac, average cost for each firm would be\nmuch higher than for a single producer producing Qac. Thus, there is a potential gain\nfrom monopoly because of lower average cost production when LRAC is decreasing so\nthat economies of scale lead to a single supplier.\n"}
