{"id": "3451", "text": "If the asset pays cash flows during the life of a call option, early exercise can be valuable\nbecause options are not adjusted for cash flows on the underlying asset. Consider a call\noption on a stock that will pay a $3 dividend. The stock price is expected to decrease by\n$3 on the ex-dividend day which will decrease the value of the call option, so exercising\nthe call option prior to the ex-dividend date may be advantageous because the stock can\nbe sold at its pre-dividend price or held to receive the dividend. Because early exercise\nmay be valuable for call options on assets with cash flows, the price of American call\noptions on assets with cash flows will be greater than the price of otherwise identical\nEuropean call options.\n"}
