{"id": 22, "text": "] three times, get 1.045890, and see that the answer is 4.589%.\nThis technique for solving for a compound growth rate is a very useful one, and you will\nsee it often.\nCalculator solution: PV = 0.88; N = 8; FV = -1.26; PMT = 0; CPT + I/Y = 4.589.\nWe can take the present value of the payments (a regular annuity) and the present value\nof the $40,000 (lump sum) and add them together. N = 25; PMT = -1,500; i = 4;\nCPT + PV = 23,433.12 and 40,000 x = 15,004.67, for a total value of\n$38,437.79.\nAlternatively, N = 25; PMT = -1,500; i = 4; FV = -40,000; CPT + PV = 38,437.79.\nFor APR, PV = 100,000; FV = -110,471.31; PMT = 0; N = 12; CPT I/Y 0.8333, which\nis the monthly rate. The APR = 12 x 0.8333, or 10%.\nAPY = 110,471.31 / 100,000 \u2013 1 = 0.10471 = 10.471% (equivalent to a compound\nmonthly rate of 0.8333%)\n"}
