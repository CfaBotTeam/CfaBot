{"id": 1495, "text": "First consider a decrease in aggregate demand, which can result from a decrease in\nthe growth rate of the money supply, an increase in taxes, a decrease in government\nspending, lower equity and house prices, or a decrease in the expectations of consumers\nand businesses for future economic growth. As illustrated in Figure 11, a decrease in\naggregate demand will reduce both real output and the price level in the short run. The\nnew short-run equilibrium output, GDP, is less than full employment (potential) GDP.\nThe decrease in aggregate demand has resulted in both lower real output and a lower\nprice level.\n"}
