{"id": 686, "text": "Oscillator charts can also be used to identify convergence or divergence of the oscillator\nand market prices. Convergence occurs when the oscillator shows the same pattern as\nprices (e.g., both reaching higher highs), and divergence occurs when the oscillator\nshows a different pattern than prices (e.g., failing to reach a higher high when the price\ndoes). Convergence suggests the price trend is likely to continue, while divergence may\nindicate a potential change in the price trend.\nExamples of oscillators include the rate of change (ROC) oscillator, Relative Strength\nIndex (RSI), moving average convergence\u017f divergence (MACD) lines, and the stochastic\noscillator.\n\u2022 Rate of change oscillator. An ROC or momentum oscillator is calculated as 100 times\nthe difference between the latest closing price and the closing price n periods earlier.\nThus, it oscillates around zero. One way technical analysts use the ROC is to buy\nwhen the oscillator changes from negative to positive during an uptrend in prices,\nand sell when the ROC changes from positive to negative during a downtrend.\nSome analysts prefer to use the ratio of the current price to the past price in place of\nthe difference. Calculated this way, the ROC oscillates around 100.\nRelative Strength Index. An RSI is based on the ratio of total price increases to\ntotal price decreases over a selected number of periods. This ratio is then scaled\nto oscillate between 0 and 100, with high values (typically those greater than 70)\nindicating an overbought market and low values (typically those less than 30)\nindicating an oversold market.\nMoving average convergence/divergence. MACD oscillators are drawn using\nexponentially smoothed moving averages, which place greater weight on more\nrecent observations. The \u201cMACD line\u201d is the difference between two exponentially\nsmoothed moving averages of the price, and the \u201csignal line\u201d is an exponentially\nsmoothed moving average of the MACD line. The lines oscillate around zero but are\nnot bounded. The MACD oscillator can be used to indicate overbought or oversold\nconditions or to identify convergence or divergence with the price trend. Points\nwhere the two lines cross can be used as trading signals, much like the use of two\ndifferent moving averages discussed previously. The MACD line crossing above the\nsmoother signal line is viewed as a buy signal and the MACD line crossing below the\nsignal line is viewed as a sell signal.\n"}
