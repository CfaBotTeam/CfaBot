{"id": "3424", "text": "To understand this possibility consider a put option at $20 on a stock with a value\nthat has decreased to $1. The intrinsic value of the put is $19 so the upside is very\nlimited, the downside (if the price of the underlying subsequently increases) is\nsignificant, and because no payment will be received until the expiration date, the\ncurrent option value reflects the present value of any expected payment. Extending\nthe time to expiration would decrease that present value. While overall we expect a\nlonger time to expiration to increase the value of a European put option, in the case\nof a deep in-the-money put, a longer time to expiration could decrease its value.\n"}
