{"id": "3452", "text": "For put options, cash flows on the underlying do not make early exercise valuable.\nActually, a decrease in the price of the underlying asset after cash distributions makes put\noptions more valuable. In the case of a put option that is deep in the money, however,\nearly exercise may be advantageous. Consider the (somewhat extreme) case of a put\noption at $20 on a stock that has fallen in value to zero. Exercising the put will result\nin an immediate payment of $20, the exercise value of the put. With a European put\noption, the $20 cannot be realized until option expiration, so its value now is only the\npresent value of $20. Given the potential positive value of early exercise for put options,\nAmerican put options can be priced higher than otherwise identical European put\noptions.\n"}
