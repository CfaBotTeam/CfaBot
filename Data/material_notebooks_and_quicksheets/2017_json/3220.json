{"id": 3220, "text": "The largest component of returns for a 7-year zero-coupon bond yielding 8%\nand held to maturity is:\nA. capital gains.\nB. interest income.\nC. reinvestment income.\nAn investor buys a buys a 10-year bond with a 6.5% annual coupon and a\nYTM of 6%. Before the first coupon payment is made, the YTM for the bond\ndecreases to 5.5%. Assuming coupon payments are reinvested at the YTM, the\ninvestor's return when the bond is held to maturity is:\nA. less than 6.0%.\nB. equal to 6.0%.\nC. greater than 6.0%.\nA 14% annual-pay coupon bond has six years to maturity. The bond is currently\ntrading at par. Using a 25 basis point change in yield, the approximate modified\nduration of the bond is closest to:\nA. 0.392.\nB. 3.888.\n.970.\nAssuming coupon interest is reinvested at a bond's YTM, what is the interest\nportion of an 18-year, $1,000 par, 5% annual coupon bond's return if it is\npurchased at par and held to maturity?\nA. $576.95\nB. $1,406.62.\nC. $1,476.95.\nEffective duration is more appropriate than modified duration for estimating\ninterest rate risk for bonds with embedded options because these bonds:\nA. tend to have greater credit risk than option-free bonds.\nB. exhibit high convexity that makes modified duration less accurate.\nC. have uncertain cash flows that depend on the path of interest rate changes.\nWhich of the following three bonds (similar except for yield and maturity) has\nthe least Macaulay duration? A bond with:\nA. 5% yield and 10-year maturity.\nB. 5% yield and 20-year maturity.\nC. 6% yield and 10-year maturity.\nPortfolio duration has limited usefulness as a measure of interest rate risk for a\nportfolio because it:\nA. assumes yield changes uniformly across all maturities.\nB. cannot be applied if the portfolio includes bonds with embedded options.\nC. is accurate only if the portfolio's internal rate of return is equal to its cash\nflow yield.\n"}
