{"id": 2194, "text": "Conditional VaR (CVar) is the expected value of a loss, given that the loss exceeds a\nminimum amount. Relating this to the Var measure presented above, the CVar would\nbe the expected loss, given that the loss was at least 200 million euros. It is calculated\nas the probability-weighted average loss for all losses expected to be at least 200 million\neuros. CVar is similar to the measure of loss given default that is used in estimating risk\nfor debt securities.\n"}
