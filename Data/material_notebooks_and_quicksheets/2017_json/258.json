{"id": 258, "text": "In practice, the covariance is difficult to interpret. This is mostly because it can take on\nextremely large values, ranging from negative to positive infinity, and, like the variance,\nthese values are expressed in terms of square units.\nTo make the covariance of two random variables easier to interpret, it may be divided by\nthe product of the random variables standard deviations. The resulting value is called\nthe correlation coefficient, or simply, correlation. The relationship between covariances,\nstandard deviations, and correlations can be seen in the following expression for the\ncorrelation of the returns for asset i and j:\nCov(R;, R;)\nCorr (R;;R;) =\no(R; )o(r,)\n, which implies Cov(R;\u201eR;) = Corr(R;\u201eR;)o(R;)o(R;)\n"}
