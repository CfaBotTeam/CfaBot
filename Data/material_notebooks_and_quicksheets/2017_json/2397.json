Investors with such accounts may choose to put securities that generate\nfully taxed income, such as corporate bond interest, in accounts that are tax deferred,\nwhile seeking long-term capital gains, tax-exempt interest income, and dividend income\n(in jurisdictions where dividends receive preferential tax treatment) in their personal\naccounts, which have no tax deferral benefit.\n"}
