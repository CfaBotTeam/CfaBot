B Monte Carlo simulation involves modeling asset prices or returns by generating random\nvalues for the risk factors that affect the price of a security.\n24. C F(x) is the cumulative probability, P(x < 20) here. Because all the observations in this\ndistribution are between 4 and 10, the probability of an outcome less than 20 is 100%.\n25. B With only two possible outcomes, there must be some positive probability for each. If\nthis were not the case, the variable in question would not be a random variable, and a\nprobability distribution would be meaningless.
