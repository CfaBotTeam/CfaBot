{"id": 1153, "text": "1. B Both monetary and fiscal policies primarily strive to achieve economic targets such\nas inflation and GDP growth. Balancing the budget is not a goal for monetary policy\nand is a potential outcome of fiscal policy. Fiscal policy (but not monetary policy) may\nsecondarily be used as a tool to redistribute income and wealth.\n2. B Money functions as a unit of account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value.\nMoney existed long before the idea of central banking was conceived.\n3. C The money multiplier is 1 / 0.15 = 6.67, so the open market purchase can increase the\nmoney supply by a maximum of $6.67 billion.\n4. A Money neutrality is the theory that changes in the money supply do not affect real\noutput or the velocity of money. Therefore, an increase in the money supply can only\nincrease the price level.\n5. C Given the equation of exchange, MV = PY, an increase in the money supply is consistent\nwith an increase in nominal GDP (PY). However, a decrease in velocity is consistent\nwith a decrease in nominal GDP. Unless we know the size of the changes in the two\nvariables, there is no way to tell what the net impact is on real GDP (Y) and prices (P).\n6. B The equation of exchange is MV = PY.\nNominal GDP = PY, so that MV = nominal GDP.\nTherefore, ($1.0 trillion)(V) = $7.0 trillion.\nV = $7.0 trillion / $1.0 trillion\nV = 7.0\n7. A The money supply schedule is vertical because the money supply is independent of\ninterest rates. Central banks control the money supply.\n8. C The Fisher effect states that nominal interest rates are equal to the real interest rate plus\nthe expected inflation rate.\n9. B Central bank goals often include maximum employment, which is interpreted as the\nmaximum sustainable growth rate of the economy; stable prices; and moderate (not\nminimum) long-term interest rates.\n10. B Lending money to government agencies is not typically a function of a central bank.\nCentral bank functions include controlling the country's money supply to keep inflation\nwithin acceptable levels and promoting a sustainable rate of economic growth, as well as\nissuing currency and regulating banks.\n11. C The money supply growth rate may need to be adjusted to keep the exchange rate within\nacceptable bounds, but is not necessarily the same as that of the other country. The other\ntwo statements are true.\n12. A The primary method by which a central bank conducts monetary policy is through\nchanges in the target short-term rate or policy rate.\n"}
