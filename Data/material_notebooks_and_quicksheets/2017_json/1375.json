{"id": 1375, "text": "in the previous period and assumes that is what it will supply in the next period. By\nsubtracting this quantity from the (linear) market demand curve, the firm can construct\na demand curve and marginal revenue curve for its own production and determine the\nprofit maximizing quantity (given constant competitor sales).\nFirms determine their quantities simultaneously each period and, under the assumptions\nof the Cournot model, these quantities will change each period until they are equal.\nWhen each firm selects the same quantity, there is no longer any additional profit to be\ngained by changing quantity, and we have a stable equilibrium. The resulting market\nprice is less than the profit maximizing price that a monopolist would charge, but higher\nthan marginal cost, the price that would result from perfect competition. Additional\nanalysis shows that as more firms are added to the model, the equilibrium market price\nfalls towards marginal cost, which is the equilibrium price in the limit as the number of\nfirms gets large.\n"}
