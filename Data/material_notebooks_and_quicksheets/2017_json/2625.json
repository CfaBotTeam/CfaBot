{"id": "2625", "text": "Abnormal profit (or risk-adjusted returns) calculations are often used to test market\nefficiency. To calculate abnormal profits, the expected return for a trading strategy is\ncalculated given its risk, using a model of expected returns such as the CAPM or a\nmultifactor model. If returns are, on average, greater than equilibrium expected returns,\nwe can reject the hypothesis of efficient prices with respect to the information on which\nthe strategy is based.\n"}
