{"id": "2575", "text": "Equal Weighting\nAn equal-weighted index places an equal weight on the returns of all index stocks,\nregardless of their prices or market values. A $2 change in the price of a $20 stock has\nthe same effect on the index as a $30 change in the price of a $300 stock regardless of\nthe size of the company. The return of an equal-weighted index over a given period is\noften calculated as a simple average of the returns of the index stocks.\n"}
