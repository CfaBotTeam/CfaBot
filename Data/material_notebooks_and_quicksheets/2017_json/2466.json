{"id": "2466", "text": "Insurance Companies\nInsurance companies are intermediaries, in that they collect insurance premiums in\nreturn for providing risk reduction to the insured. The insurance firm can do this\nefficiently because it provides protection to a diversified pool of policyholders, whose\nrisks of loss are typically uncorrelated. This provides more predictable losses and cash\nflows compared to a single insurance contract, in the same way that a bank's diversified\nportfolio of loans diversifies the risk of loan defaults.\n"}
