{"id": "2303", "text": "A simplifying assumption underlying modern portfolio theory (and the capital asset\npricing model, which is introduced later in this topic review) is that investors have\nhomogeneous expectations (i.e., they all have the same estimates of risk, return, and\ncorrelations with other risky assets for all risky assets). Under this assumption, all\ninvestors face the same efficient frontier of risky portfolios and will all have the same\noptimal risky portfolio and CAL.\nFigure 3 illustrates the determination of the optimal risky portfolio and optimal CAL\nfor all investors under the assumption of homogeneous expectations. Note that, under\nthis assumption, the optimal CAL for any investor is the one that is just tangent to the\nefficient frontier. Depending on their preferences for risk and return (their indifference\ncurves), investors may choose different portfolio weights for the risk-free asset and the\nrisky (tangency) portfolio. Every investor, however, will use the same risky portfolio.\nWhen this is the case, that portfolio must be the market portfolio of all risky assets\nbecause all investors that hold any risky assets hold the same portfolio of risky assets.\n"}
