{"id": 3336, "text": "A deliverable forward contract is settled by the short delivering the underlying asset to\nthe long. Other forward contracts are settled in cash. In a cash-settled forward contract,\none party pays cash to the other when the contract expires based on the difference\nbetween the forward price and the market price of the underlying asset (i.e., the spot\nprice) at the settlement date. Apart from transactions costs, deliverable and cash-settled\nforward contracts are economically equivalent. Cash-settled forward contracts are also\nknown as contracts for differences or non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).\n"}
