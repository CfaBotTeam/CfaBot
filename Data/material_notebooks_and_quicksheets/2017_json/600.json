{"id": "600", "text": "Keep in mind that we have been describing two distinct hypothesis tests, one about the\nsignificance of the difference between the means of two populations and one about the\nsignificance of the mean of the differences between pairs of observations. Here are rules\nfor when these tests may be applied:\nThe test of the differences in means is used when there are two independent samples.\nA test of the significance of the mean of the differences between paired\nobservations is used when the samples are not independent.\n"}
