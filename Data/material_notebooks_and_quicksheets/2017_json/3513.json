{"id": 3513, "text": "Alternative investment returns have had low correlations with those of traditional\ninvestments over long periods. The primary motivation for holding alternative\ninvestments is their historically low correlation of returns with those of traditional\ninvestments, which can reduce an investor's overall portfolio risk. However, the\nrisk measures we use for traditional assets may not be adequate to capture the risk\ncharacteristics of alternative investments. Managers often consider measures of risk\nother than standard deviation of returns, such as worst month or historical frequency of\ndownside returns.\n"}
