{"id": "1660", "text": "Professor's Note: Throughout the discussion of the direct and indirect methods,\nremember the following points:\nCFO is calculated differently, but the result is the same under both methods.\nThe calculation of CFI and CFF is identical under both methods.\nThere is an inverse relationship between changes in assets and changes in cash\nflows. In other words, an increase in an asset account is a use of cash, and a\ndecrease in an asset account is a source of cash.\nThere is a direct relationship between changes in liabilities and changes in\ncash flow. In other words, an increase in a liability account is a source of cash,\nand a decrease in a liability is a use of cash.\nSources of cash are positive numbers (cash inflows) and uses of cash are\nnegative numbers (cash outflows).\n"}
