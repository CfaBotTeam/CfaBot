{"id": 1187, "text": "Governments sometimes place restrictions on the flow of investment capital into their\ncountry, out of their country, or both. Commonly cited objectives of capital flow\nrestrictions include the following:\nReduce the volatility of domestic asset prices. In times of macroeconomic crisis, capital\nflows out of the country can drive down asset prices drastically, especially prices of\nliquid assets such as stocks and bonds. With no restrictions on inflows or outflows\nof foreign investment capital, the asset markets of countries with economies that\nare small relative to the amount of foreign investment can be quite volatile over a\ncountry's economic cycle.\nMaintain fixed exchange rates. For countries with fixed exchange rate targets, limiting\nflows of foreign investment capital makes it easier to meet the exchange rate target\nand, therefore, to be able to use monetary and fiscal policy to pursue only the\neconomic goals for the domestic economy.\nKeep domestic interest rates low. By restricting the outflow of investment capital,\ncountries can keep their domestic interest rates low and manage the domestic\neconomy with monetary policy, as investors cannot pursue higher rates in foreign\ncountries. China is an example of a country with a fixed exchange rate regime where\nrestrictions on capital flows allow policymakers to maintain the target exchange rate\nas well as to pursue a monetary policy independent of concerns about its effect on\ncurrency exchange rates.\nProtect strategic industries. Governments sometimes prohibit investment by foreign\nentities in industries considered to be important for national security, such as the\ntelecommunications and defense industries.\nLOS 19.h: Describe the balance of payments accounts including their\ncomponents.\n"}
