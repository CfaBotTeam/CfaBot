This is what lies behind collusive agreements by or among firms.\nIf firms can enter into and enforce an agreement to restrict output and charge higher\nprices, and share the resulting profits, they are better off. There are, however, laws (antitrust laws) against such collusive agreements to restrain competition to protect the\ninterests of consumers. The OPEC oil cartel is an example of such a collusive agreement,\nbut evidence is common that cartel members regularly cheat on their agreements to\nshare the optimal output of oil.\n"}
