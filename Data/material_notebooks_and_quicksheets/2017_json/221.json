{"id": "221", "text": "Calculating the Probability That at Least One of Two Events Will Occur\nThe addition rule for probabilities is used to determine the probability that at least one\nof two events will occur. For example, given two events, A and B, the addition rule can\nbe used to determine the probability that either A or B will occur. If the events are not\nmutually exclusive, double counting must be avoided by subtracting the joint probability\n"}
