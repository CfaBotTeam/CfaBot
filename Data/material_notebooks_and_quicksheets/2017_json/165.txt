{"id": 165, "text": "Kurtosis is critical in a risk management setting. Most research about the distribution of\nsecurities returns has shown that returns are not normally distributed. Actual securities\nreturns tend to exhibit both skewness and kurtosis. Skewness and kurtosis are critical\nconcepts for risk management because when securities returns are modeled using an\nassumed normal distribution, the predictions from the models will not take into account\nthe potential for extremely large, negative outcomes. In fact, most risk managers put\nvery little emphasis on the mean and standard deviation of a distribution and focus more\non the distribution of returns in the tails of the distribution\u2014that is where the risk is.\nIn general, greater positive kurtosis and more negative skew in returns distributions\nindicates increased risk.\n"}
