{"id": "1545", "text": "When an expansion is approaching its peak, sales growth begins to slow, and unsold\ninventories accumulate. This can be seen in an increase in the inventory-sales ratio\nabove its normal level. Firms respond to an unplanned increase in inventory by reducing\nproduction, which is one of the causes of the subsequent contraction in the economy.\nAn increase in inventories is counted in the GDP statistics as economic output, whether\nthe increase is planned or unplanned. An analyst who looks only at GDP growth, rather\nthan the inventory-sales ratio, might see economic strength rather than the beginning of\nweakness.\n"}
