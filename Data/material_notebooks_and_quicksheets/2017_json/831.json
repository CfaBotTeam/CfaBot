Some of these\nmisleading practices included:\nRepresentative accounts\u2014showing a top-performing portfolio as representative of a\nfirm's results.\nSurvivorship bias\u2014excluding \"weak performance\u201d accounts that have been\nterminated.\nVarying time periods\u2014showing performance for selected time periods with\noutstanding returns.\nGIPS are a set of ethical principles based on a standardized, industry-wide\napproach. Investment firms can voluntarily follow GIPS in their presentation of\nhistorical investment results to prospective clients. These standards seek to avoid\nmisrepresentations of performance.\n"}
