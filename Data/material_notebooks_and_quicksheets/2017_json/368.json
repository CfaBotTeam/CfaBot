Multivariate\ndistributions between two discrete random variables are described using joint probability\ntables. For continuous random variables, a multivariate normal distribution may be\nused to describe them if all of the individual variables follow a normal distribution. As\npreviously mentioned, one of the characteristics of a normal distribution is that a linear\ncombination of normally distributed random variables is normally distributed as well.\nFor example, if the return of each stock in a portfolio is normally distributed, the return\non the portfolio will also be normally distributed.\n"}
