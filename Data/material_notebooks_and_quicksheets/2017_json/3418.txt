{"id": 3418, "text": "There are six factors that determine option prices.\n1. Price of the underlying asset. For call options, the higher the price of the\nunderlying, the greater its intrinsic value and the higher the value of the option.\nConversely, the lower the price of the underlying, the less its intrinsic value and the\nlower the value of the call option. In general, call option values increase when the\nvalue of the underlying asset increases.\nFor put options this relationship is reversed. An increase in the price of the\nunderlying reduces the value of a put option.\n"}
