{"id": 975, "text": "The cash flow additivity principle refers to the fact that present value of any stream\nof cash flows equals the sum of the present values of the cash flows. There are different\napplications of this principle in time value of money problems. If we have two series\nof cash flows, the sum of the present values of the two series is the same as the present\nvalues of the two series taken together, adding cash flows that will be paid at the same\npoint in time. We can also divide up a series of cash flows any way we like, and the\npresent value of the \u201cpieces\u201d will equal the present value of the original series.\n"}
