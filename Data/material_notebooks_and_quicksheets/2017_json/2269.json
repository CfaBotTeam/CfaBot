{"id": "2269", "text": "Now that we have constructed a set of the possible efficient portfolios (the capital\nallocation line), we can combine this with indifference curves representing an\nindividual's preferences for risk and return to illustrate the logic of selecting an optimal\nportfolio (i.e., one that maximizes the investor's expected utility). In Figure 6, we can see\nthat Investor A, with preferences represented by indifference curves I, I, and 13, can\nreach the level of expected utility on I, by selecting portfolio X. This is the optimal\nportfolio for this investor, as any portfolio that lies on I, is preferred to all portfolios\nthat lie on Iz (and in fact to any portfolios that lie between I, and Iz). Portfolios on li\nare preferred to those on I, but none of the portfolios that lie on I, are available in the\nmarket.\n"}
