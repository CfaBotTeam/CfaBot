{"id": 2289, "text": "The principal-agent conflict arises because an agent is hired to act in the interest of the\nprincipal, but an agen's interests may not coincide exactly with those of the principal.\nConsider an insurance agent who is paid a commission on policies written. It would\nbe in the agent\u2019s interest to write insurance policies on people or property that are not\ngood risks, in order to maximize commission income. The principal (the owners of the\ninsurance company) does not want to issue policies that are bad risks as that is a moneylosing proposition. Insurance companies mitigate this conflict by imposing underwriting\nstandards for the policies they will issue and by continuing to work only with agents\nwho consistently act in the company's best interest.\n"}
