{"id": "1177", "text": "When the price of Good X decreases, there is a substitution effect that shifts\nconsumption towards more of Good X. Because the total expenditure on the consumer's\noriginal bundle of goods falls when the price of Good X falls, there is also an income\neffect. The income effect can be toward more or less consumption of Good X. This is\nthe key point here: the substitution effect always acts to increase the consumption of\na good that has fallen in price, while the income effect can either increase or decrease\nconsumption of a good that has fallen in price.\n"}
