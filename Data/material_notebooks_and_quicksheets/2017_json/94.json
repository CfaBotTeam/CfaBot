{"id": "94", "text": "Exam Focus\nThis quantitative review is about the uses of descriptive statistics to summarize and\nportray important characteristics of large sets of data. The two key areas that you should\nconcentrate on are (1) measures of central tendency and (2) measures of dispersion.\nMeasures of central tendency include the arithmetic mean, geometric mean, weighted\nmean, median, and mode. Measures of dispersion include the range, mean absolute\ndeviation, and the most important measure for us, variance. These measures quantify\nthe variability of data around its \u201ccenter.\" When describing investments, measures of\ncentral tendency provide an indication of an investment's expected return. Measures\nof dispersion indicate the riskiness of an investment. For the Level I exam, you should\nknow the properties of a normal distribution and be able to recognize departures from\nnormality, such as lack of symmetry (skewness) or the extent to which a distribution is\npeaked (kurtosis).\n"}
