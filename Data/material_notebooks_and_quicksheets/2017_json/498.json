{"id": "498", "text": "A simple random sample is a sample drawn in such a way that each member of\nthe population has:\nA. some chance of being selected in the sample.\nB. an equal chance of being included in the sample.\nC. a 1% chance of being included in the sample.\nSampling error is defined as:\nA. an error that occurs when a sample of less than 30 elements is drawn.\nB. an error that occurs during collection, recording, and tabulation of data.\nC. the difference between the value of a sample statistic and the value of the\ncorresponding population parameter.\nThe mean age of all CFA candidates is 28 years. The mean age of a random\nsample of 100 candidates is found to be 26.5 years. The difference of 1.5 years is\ncalled the:\nA. random error.\nB. sampling error.\nC. population error.\nIf n is large and the population standard deviation is unknown, the standard\nerror of the sampling distribution of the sample mean is equal to the:\nA. sample standard deviation divided by the sample size.\nB. population standard deviation multiplied by the sample size.\nC. sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\nThe standard error of the sampling distribution of the sample mean for a sample\nsize of n drawn from a population with a mean of p and a standard deviation of\no is:\nA. sample standard deviation divided by the sample size.\nB. sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\nC. population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\nTo apply the central limit theorem to the sampling distribution of the sample\nmean, the sample is usually considered to be large if n is greater than:\nA. 20.\nB. 25.\nC. 30.\nAssume that a population has a mean of 14 with a standard deviation of 2.
