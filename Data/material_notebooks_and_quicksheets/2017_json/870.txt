{"id": 870, "text": "As long as you do not change the P/Y setting, it will remain set at one period per year\nuntil the battery from your calculator is removed (it does not change when you turn the\ncalculator on and off). If you want to check this setting at any time, press (2nd] [P/Y).\nThe display should read P/Y = 1.0. If it does, press (2nd] [QUIT] to get out of the\n\u201cprogramming\u201d mode. If it doesn't, repeat the procedure previously described to set the\nPIY key. With P/Y set to equal 1, it is now possible to think of I/Y as the interest rate\nper compounding period and N as the number of compounding periods under analysis.\nThinking of these keys in this way should help you keep things straight as we work\nthrough TVM problems.\n"}
