Over the course of study you should periodically take\nadditional quizzes from the QBank on topics you previously studied to improve your\nretention of that material through exam day. This also allows you to further improve\nyour knowledge and understanding by reviewing the SchweserNotes for areas in which\nyou do not do well in the quizzes.\n"}
