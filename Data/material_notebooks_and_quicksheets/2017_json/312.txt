{"id": 312, "text": "The correlation of returns between the returns on Cape Products and Dogger\nIndustries is 0.6. The standard deviation of returns for Cape is 15%, and the\nstandard deviation of returns for Dogger is 20%. The expected return for\nDogger is 18%, and the expected return for Cape is 12%. Calculate the expected\nreturns and standard deviation of returns on a portfolio that has $300,000\ninvested in Dogger and $200,000 invested in Cape.\nM. Atwood, an analyst, has developed a scoring system for bonds and found that\nif the score from a bond is less than 20, there is an 85% probability that it will\ndefault within five years. If a bond's score is greater than or equal to 20, there is\nonly a 40% chance that it will default within five years. Given that a randomly\nchosen bond currently has a 25% probability of a score less than 20, what is the\nprobability that a bond that defaults within the next five years had a score of 20\nor higher?\nA bond that matures in one year is priced at $950 today. You estimate that it has\na 10% probability of default. If the bond defaults, you expect to recover $600. If\nit does not default, it will pay $1,080 at maturity. The nominal 1-year risk-free\nrate is 7.5%.\nA. What are the odds against this bond defaulting?\n"}
