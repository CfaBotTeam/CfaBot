{"id": 3099, "text": "Reverse stock splits are the opposite of stock splits. After a reverse split, there are fewer\nshares outstanding but a higher stock price. Because these factors offset one another,\nshareholder wealth is unchanged. The logic behind a reverse stock split is that the\nperceived optimal stock price range is $20 to $80 per share, and most investors consider\na stock with a price less than $5 per share less than investment grade. Exchanges may\nimpose a minimum stock price and delist those that fall below that price. A company in\nfinancial distress whose stock has fallen dramatically may declare a reverse stock split to\nincrease the stock price.\n"}
