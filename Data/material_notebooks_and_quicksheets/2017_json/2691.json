The\nmore optimistic investors are about the firm's future growth, the greater its price-to-book\nratio. The price-to-book ratio is used as a measure of relative value. Often, firms with\nlow price-to-book ratios are considered value stocks, while firms with high price-to-book\nratios are considered growth stocks.\n"}
