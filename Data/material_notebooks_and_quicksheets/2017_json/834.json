{"id": "834", "text": "A composite, such as International Equities, must include all fee-paying, discretionary\nportfolios (current and past) that the firm has managed in accordance with this\nparticular strategy. The firm should identify which composite each managed portfolio is\nto be included in before the portfolio's performance is known. This prevents firms from\nchoosing portfolios to include in a composite in order to create composites with superior\nreturns.\n"}
