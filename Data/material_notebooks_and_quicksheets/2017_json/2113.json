{"id": 2113, "text": "A company with a short payables period (high payables turnover) may simply be taking\nadvantage of discounts for paying early because it has good low-cost funds available\nto finance its working capital needs. A company with a long payables period may be\nsuch an important buyer that it can effectively utilize accounts payable as a source of\nshort-term funding with relatively little cost (because suppliers will put up with it).\nMonitoring the changes in days' payables outstanding over time for a single firm will,\nhowever, aid the analyst. An extension of days' payables may serve as an early warning of\ndeteriorating short-term liquidity.\n"}
