{"id": "477", "text": "Here, we will use the t-reliability factor because the population variance is unknown.\nSince there are 30 observations, the degrees of freedom are 29 = 30 \u2013 1. Remember,\nbecause this is a two-tailed test at the 95% confidence level, the probability under\neach tail must be a/2 = 2.5%, for a total of 5%. So, referencing the one-tailed\nprobabilities for Student\u2019s t-distribution at the back of this book, we find the critical\nt-value (reliability factor) for a/2 = 0.025 and df = 29 to be t29, 2.5 = 2.045. Thus,\nthe 95% confidence interval for the population mean is:\n2% + 2.045 20= 2% \u00a32.045(3.6%) = 2% +7.4%\n"}
