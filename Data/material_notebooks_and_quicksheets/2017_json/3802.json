{"id": "3802", "text": "Professor's Note: Simple averages also give decent approximations for calculating\nforward rates from spot rates. In the preceding example, we had spot rates of\n4% for one year and 8% for two years. Two years at 8% is 16%, so if the\nfirst-year rate is 4%, the second-year rate is close to 16 -4 = 12% (actual is\n12.154). Given a 2-year spot rate of 8% and a 3-year spot rate of 12%, we could\napproximate the 1-year forward rate from time two to time three as (3 x 12) \u2013\n(2 x 8) = 20. That may be close enough (actual is 20.45) to answer a multiplechoice question and, in any case, serves as a good check to make sure the exact rate\nyou calculate is reasonable.\n"}
