{"id": "1496", "text": "Because real GDP is less than full employment GDP, we say there is a recessionary gap.\nA recession is a period of declining GDP and rising unemployment. Classical economists\nbelieved that unemployment would drive down wages, as workers compete for available\njobs, which in turn would increase SRAS and return the economy to its full employment\nlevel of real GDP. Keynesian economists, on the other hand, believe that this might\nbe a slow and economically painful process and that increasing aggregate demand\nthrough government action is the preferred alternative. Both expansionary fiscal policy\n(increasing government spending or decreasing taxes) and expansionary monetary policy\n(increasing the growth rate of the money supply to reduce interest rates) are methods to\nincreace aooregate demand and return real GDP to its full employment (notential) level.\n\u00a92016 Kaplan, Inc.\n"}
