{"id": 2741, "text": "Barriers to Entry\nHigh barriers to entry benefit existing industry firms because they prevent new\ncompetitors from competing for market share and reducing the existing firms' return\non capital. In industries with low barriers to entry, firms have little pricing power and\ncompetition reduces existing firms' return on capital. To assess the ease of entry, the\nanalyst should determine how easily a new entrant to the industry could obtain the\ncapital, intellectual property, and customer base needed to be successful. One method of\ndetermining the ease of entry is to examine the composition of the industry over time. If\nthe same firms dominate the industry today as ten years ago, entry is probably difficult.\nHigh barriers to entry do not necessarily mean firm pricing power is high. Industries\nwith high barriers to entry may have strong price competition among existing firms. This\nis more likely when the products sold are undifferentiated and commodity-like or when\nhigh barriers to exit result in overcapacity. For example, an automobile factory may have\na low value in an alternative use, making firm owners less likely to exit the industry.\nThey continue to operate even when losing money, hoping to turn things around, which\ncan result in industry overcapacity and intense price competition.\nLow barriers to entry do not ensure success for new entrants. Barriers to entry may\nchange over time, and so might the competitive environment.\n"}
