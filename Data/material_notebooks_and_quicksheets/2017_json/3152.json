{"id": "3152", "text": "For an investor with a short investment horizon, interest rate risk increases and\nreinvestment risk decreases. For the investor with a one-year investment horizon, there\nwas no reinvestment risk because the bond was sold before any interest on coupon\npayments was earned. The investor had only market price risk so an increase in yield\ndecreased the rate of return over the one-year holding period because the sale price is\nlower. Conversely, a decrease in yield increased the one-year holding period return to\nmore than the YTM at purchase because the sale price is higher.\n"}
