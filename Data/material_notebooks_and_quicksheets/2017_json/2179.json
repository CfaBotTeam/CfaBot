{"id": "2179", "text": "Exam Focus\nHere we present a framework for risk management that is broad enough to be applied to\ncorporations in general, financial firms, and individuals, as well as to the management\nof securities portfolios in any context. The main idea is that organizations should\nestimate the various risks they face and then reduce some risks and accept or increase\nother risks. The result should be a bundle of risks that simultaneously matches the risk\ntolerance of the organization and provides the greatest benefits in terms of reaching the\norganization's goals. Note that risk is not minimized though this process. The concept\nof risk budgeting, the categorization of types of risks, and the various methods of risk\nmitigation all offer testable material.\n"}
