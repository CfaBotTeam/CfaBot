{"id": "544", "text": "the significance level (probability of a Type I error) from 5% to 1%, for example, will\nincrease the probability of failing to reject a false null (Type II error) and therefore\nreduce the power of the test. Conversely, for a given sample size, we can increase the\npower of a test only with the cost that the probability of rejecting a true null (Type I\nerror) increases. For a given significance level, we can decrease the probability of a Type\nII error and increase the power of a test, only by increasing the sample size.\n"}
