{"id": 2048, "text": "Professor's Note: The difference between testing for impairment and measuring the\nimpairment loss can be confusing. In testing for impairment, undiscounted cash\nflows are used. Once impairment has been detected, the loss is based on fair value\nor the discounted expected future cash flows. Using undiscounted cash flows to test\nfor impairment keeps PP\u00c9E assets from becoming \"impaired\u201d by increases in the\ndiscount rate when interest rates increase.\n"}
