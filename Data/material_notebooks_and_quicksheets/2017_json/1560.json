{"id": 1560, "text": "The Great Depression of the 1930s did not support the beliefs of the neoclassical\neconomists. The economy in the United States operated significantly below its fullemployment level for many years. Additionally, business cycles in general have been\nmore severe and more prolonged than the neoclassical model would suggest.\nBritish economist John Maynard Keynes attempted to explain the Depression and the\nnature of business cycles. He provided policy recommendations for moving the economy\ntoward full-employment GDP and reducing the severity and duration of business cycles.\nKeynes believed that shifts in aggregate demand due to changes in expectations were the\nprimary cause of business cycles. Keynesian school economists believe these fluctuations\nare primarily due to swings in the level of optimism of those who run businesses.\nThey overinvest and overproduce when they are too optimistic about future growth in\npotential GDP, and they underinvest and underproduce when they are too pessimistic or\nfearful about the future growth in potential GDP.\n"}
