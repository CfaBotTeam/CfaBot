{"id": 209, "text": "A random variable is an uncertain quantity/number.\nAn outcome is an observed value of a random variable.\nAn event is a single outcome or a set of outcomes.\nMutually exclusive events are events that cannot both happen at the same time.\nExhaustive events are those that include all possible outcomes.\nConsider rolling a 6-sided die. The number that comes up is a random variable. If you\nroll a 4, that is an outcome. Rolling a 4 is an event, and rolling an even number is an\nevent. Rolling a 4 and rolling a 6 are mutually exclusive events. Rolling an even number\nand rolling an odd number is a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events.\n"}
