{"id": "2461", "text": "Securitizers pool large amounts of securities or other assets and then sell interests in the\npool to other investors. The returns from the pool, net of the securitizer's fees, are passed\nthrough to the investors. By securitizing the assets, the securitizer creates a diversified\npool of assets with more predictable cash flows than the individual assets in the pool.\nThis creates liquidity in the assets because the ownership interests are more easily valued\nand traded. There are also economies of scale in the management costs of large pools of\nassets and potential benefits from the manager's selection of assets.\n"}
