{"id": "485", "text": "Sample selection bias occurs when some data is systematically excluded from the\nanalysis, usually because of the lack of availability. This practice renders the observed\nsample to be nonrandom, and any conclusions drawn from this sample can't be applied\nto the population because the observed sample and the portion of the population that\nwas not observed are different.\nSurvivorship bias is the most common form of sample selection bias. A good example\nof the existence of survivorship bias in investments is the study of mutual fund\nperformance. Most mutual fund databases, like Morningstar\u00ba's, only include funds\ncurrently in existence\u2014the \u201csurvivors.\u201d They do not include funds that have ceased to\nexist due to closure or merger.\nThis would not be a problem if the characteristics of the surviving funds and the missing\nfunds were the same; then the sample of survivor funds would still be a random sample\ndrawn from the population of mutual funds. As one would expect, however, and as\nevidence has shown, the funds that are dropped from the sample have lower returns\nrelative to the surviving funds. Thus, the surviving sample is biased toward the better\nfunds (i.e., it is not random). The analysis of a mutual fund sample with survivorship\nbias will yield results that overestimate the average mutual fund return because the\ndatabase only includes the better-performing funds. The solution to survivorship bias is\nto use a sample of funds that all started at the same time and not drop funds that have\nbeen dropped from the sample.\n"}
