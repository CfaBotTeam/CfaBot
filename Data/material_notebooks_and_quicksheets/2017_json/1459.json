An increase in personal income or\na decrease in taxes will increase both consumption and saving. Additional disposable\nincome will be consumed or saved. The proportion of additional income spent\non consumption is called the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), and the\nproportion saved is the marginal propensity to save (MPS). MPC + MPS must\nequal 100%.\n"}
