{"id": 387, "text": "Step 2: Choose the portfolio that has the largest SFRatio.\nExample: Roy's safety-first criterion\nFor the next year, the managers of a $120 million college endowment plan have set a\nminimum acceptable end-of-year portfolio value of $123.6 million. Three portfolios\nare being considered which have the expected returns and standard deviation shown\nin the first two rows of the table below. Determine which of these portfolios is the\nmost desirable using Roy's safety-first criterion and the probability that the portfolio\nvalue will fall short of the target amount.\nAnswer:\nThe threshold return is R = (123.6 - 120) / 120 = 0.030 = 3%. The SFRs are shown\nin the table below. As indicated, the best choice is Portfolio A because it has the\nlargest SFR.\nRoy's Safety-First Ratios\nPortfolio Portfolio A\nPortfolio B\nPortfolio C\nE(R) 9% 11%\n9%\n11%\n6.6%\n12%\n12%\n20%\n8.2%\n"}
