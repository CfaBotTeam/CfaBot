{"id": 1832, "text": "Dividends are declared on a per-common-share basis. Total dividends on a firm-wide\nbasis are referred to as dividends declared. Neither EPS nor net income is reduced by\nthe payment of common stock dividends. Net income minus dividends declared is\nretained earnings, the earnings that are used to grow the corporation rather than being\ndistributed to equity holders. The proportion of a firm's net income that is retained to\nfund growth is an important determinant of the firm's sustainable growth rate.\nTo estimate the sustainable growth rate for a firm, the rate of return on resources is\nmeasured as the return on equity capital, or the ROE. The proportion of earnings\nreinvested is known as the retention rate (RR).\n\u2022 The formula for the sustainable growth rate, which is how fast the firm can grow\nwithout additional external equity issues while holding leverage constant, is:\ng = RR < ROE\nThe calculation of the retention rate is:\nnet income available to common - dividends declared\nretention rate =\nnet income available to common\n=1- dividend payout ratio\n"}
