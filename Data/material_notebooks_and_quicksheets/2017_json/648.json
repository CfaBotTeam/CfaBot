The appropriate test is a two-tailed chi-square test. The decision\nrule is to reject H, if the test statistic is outside the range defined by the critical\nchi-square values at a/ 2 = 0.025 with df = 29. The test statistic is:\n2 (n-1)s?

This means\nthe population standard deviation is not significantly different than $300.\n"}
