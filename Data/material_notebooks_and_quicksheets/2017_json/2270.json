Recall that the less an investor's risk aversion,\nthe flatter his indifference curves. As illustrated in Figure 7, the latter indifference curve\nfor Investor B (13) results in an optimal (tangency) portfolio that lies to the right of the\none that results from a steeper indifference curve, such as that for Investor A (I). An\ninvestor who is less risk averse should optimally choose a portfolio with more invested in\nthe risky asset portfolio and less invested in the risk-free asset.\n"}
