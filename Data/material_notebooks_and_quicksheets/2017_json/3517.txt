{"id": 3517, "text": "Hedge fund investments are less liquid than traditional, publicly traded investments.\nRestrictions on redemptions may include a lockup period and/or a notice period.\nA lockup period is a time after initial investment during which withdrawals are not\nallowed. A notice period, typically 30 to 90 days, is the amount of time a fund has after\nreceiving a redemption request to fulfill the request. Additional fees may be charged\nat redemption. All of these, of course, discourage redemptions. Hedge fund managers\noften incur significant transactions costs when they redeem shares. Redemption fees\ncan offset these costs. Notice periods allow time for managers to reduce positions in\nan orderly manner. Redemptions often increase when hedge fund performance is poor\nover a period, and the costs of honoring redemptions may further decrease the value of\npartnership interests. This is an additional source of risk for hedge fund investors.\n"}
