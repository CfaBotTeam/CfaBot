{"id": 671, "text": "the analyst must choose a \u201creversal size\" for the chart. A typical reversal size is three\ntimes the box size.\nStarting from the opening price, the analyst will fill in a box in the first column if the\nclosing price has changed by at least the box size. An X indicates an increase of one\nbox size and an O indicates a decrease. If the price changes by more than one box size,\nthe analyst will fill in multiple Xs or Os. If the price continues in the same direction in\nthe next periods, the analyst will continue filling in the same column. When the price\nchanges in the opposite direction by at least the reversal size, the analyst will begin the\nnext column (see panel b of Figure 3).\n"}
