{"id": "2666", "text": "Common shares are the most common form of equity and represent an ownership\ninterest. Common shareholders have a residual claim (after the claims of debtholders\nand preferred stockholders) on firm assets if the firm is liquidated and govern the\ncorporation through voting rights. Firms are under no obligation to pay dividends on\ncommon equity; the firm determines what dividend will be paid periodically. Common\nstockholders are able to vote for the board of directors, on merger decisions, and on the\nselection of auditors. If they are unable to attend the annual meeting, shareholders can\nvote by proxy (having someone else vote as they direct them, on their behalf).\nIn a statutory voting system, each share held is assigned one vote in the election of each\nmember of the board of directors. Under cumulative voting, shareholders can allocate\ntheir votes to one or more candidates as they choose. For example, consider a situation\nwhere a shareholder has 100 shares and three directors will be elected. Under statutory\nvoting, the shareholder can vote 100 shares for his director choice in each election.\nUnder cumulative voting, the shareholder has 300 votes, which can be cast for a single\ncandidate or spread across multiple candidates. The three receiving the greatest number\nof votes are elected. Cumulative voting makes it possible for a minority shareholder to\nhave more proportional representation on the board. The way the math works, a holder\nof 30% of the firm's shares could choose three of ten directors with cumulative voting\nbut could elect no directors under statutory voting.\n"}
