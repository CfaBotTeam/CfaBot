{"id": 3856, "text": "For a lender, loans with lower LTVs are less risky because the borrower has more to lose\nin the event of default (so is less likely to default). Also, if the property value is high\ncompared to the loan amount, the lender is more likely to recover the amount loaned\nif the borrower defaults and the lender repossesses and sells the property. In the United\nStates, mortgages with higher LTV ratios, made to borrowers with good credit, are\ntermed prime loans. Mortgages to borrowers of lower credit quality, or that have a lowerpriority claim to the collateral in event of default, are termed subprime loans.\n"}
