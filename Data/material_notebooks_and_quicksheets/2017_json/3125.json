In a securitization, the firm that is securitizing financial assets is\ndescribed as the seller because it sells the assets to the SPE. The servicer is the entity that\ndeals with collections on the securitized assets.\n3. C An interest-only lifetime mortgage includes no repayment of principal in its monthly\npayments so the balloon payment at maturity is equal to the original loan principal. A\nfully amortizing mortgage has no balloon payment at maturity. A convertible mortgage\ngives the borrower an option to change the loan from fixed-rate to adjustable-rate or\nfrom adjustable-rate to fixed-rate.\n4. A Conforming loans that may be securitized in agency RMBS have a maximum loan-tovalue ratio, along with other requirements such as minimum percentage down payments\nand insurance on the mortgaged property.\n5. B Issuing CMOs may allow the issuer to raise funds at a lower cost by creating tranches\nthat appeal to investors with different preferences for extension risk and contraction\nrisk. CMOs do not reduce these risks compared to their pool of collateral; they only\ndistribute the risks among the various CMO tranches.\n6. B Balloon risk is the possibility that a commercial mortgage borrower will not be able to\nrefinance the principal that is due at the maturity date of the mortgage. This results in\na default that is typically resolved by extending the term of the loan during a workout\nperiod. Thus, balloon risk is a source of extension risk for CMBS investors.\n7. c During the lockout period on a credit card receivables backed ABS, no principal\npayments are made to investors.\n8. B A collateralized debt obligation or CDO is backed by an underlying pool of debt\nsecurities, which may include emerging markets debt. Both collateralized mortgage\nobligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities are backed by mortgages only.\n"}
