{"id": "2730", "text": "Non-cyclical industries can be further separated into defensive (stable) or growth\nindustries. Defensive industries are those that are least affected by the stage of the\nbusiness cycle and include utilities, consumer staples (such as food producers), and basic\nservices (such as drug stores). Growth industries have demand so strong they are largely\nunaffected by the stage of the business cycle.\nDescriptors such as \u201cgrowth,\u201d \u201cdefensive,\u201d and \u201ccyclical\u201d should be used with caution.\nCyclical industries, which are supposed to be dependent on the business cycle, often\ninclude growth firms that are less dependent on the business cycle. Non-cyclical\nindustries can be affected by severe recessions, as was the case in the 2008\u201309 downturn.\nDefensive industries may not always be safe investments. For example, grocery stores\nare classified as defensive, but they are subject to intense price competition that reduces\nearnings. Defensive industries may also contain some truly defensive and some growth\nfirms. Because business cycle phases differ across countries and regions, two cyclical\nfirms operating in different countries may be simultaneously experiencing different\ncyclical effects on earnings growth.\n"}
