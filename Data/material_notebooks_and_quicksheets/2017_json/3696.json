{"id": 3696, "text": "Commercial paper is often reissued or rolled over when it matures. The risk that a\ncompany will not be able to sell new commercial paper to replace maturing paper is\ntermed rollover risk. The two important circumstances in which a company will face\nrollover difficulties are (1) there is a deterioration in a company's actual or perceived\nability to repay the debt at maturity, which will significantly increase the required yield\non the paper or lead to less-than-full subscription to a new issue, and (2) significant\nsystemic financial distress, as was experienced in the 2008 financial crisis, that may\n\u201cfreeze\u201d debt markets so that very little commercial paper can be sold at all.\n"}
