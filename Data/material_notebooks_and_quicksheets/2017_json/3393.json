{"id": "3393", "text": "FRAs are used by firms to hedge the risk of (remove uncertainty about) borrowing and\nlending they intend to do in the future. A company that intends to borrow funds in 30\ndays could take a long position in an FRA, receiving a payment if future 90-day Libor\n(and its borrowing cost) increases, and making a payment if future 90-day Libor (and its\nborrowing cost) decreases, over the 30-day life of the FRA. Note a perfect hedge means\nnot only that the firm's borrowing costs will not be higher if rates increase, but also that\nthe firm's borrowing costs will not be lower if interest rates decrease.\n"}
