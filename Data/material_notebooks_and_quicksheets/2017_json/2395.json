{"id": "2395", "text": "Time horizon: In general, the longer an investor's time horizon, the more risk and\nless liquidity the investor can accept in the portfolio. While the expected returns on a\nbroad equities portfolio may not be too risky for an investor with a 20-year investment\nhorizon, they likely are too risky for an investor who must fund a large purchase at\nthe end of this year. For such an investor, government securities or a bank certificate\nof deposit may be the most appropriate investments because of their low risk and high\nliquidity at the time when the funds will be needed.\n"}
