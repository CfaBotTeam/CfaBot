{"id": "2748", "text": "In the shakeout stage, industry growth and profitability are slowing due to strong\ncompetition. The characteristics of this stage are as follows:\nGrowth has slowed: demand reaches saturation level with few new customers to be\nfound.\n\u2022 Intense competition: industry growth has slowed, so firm growth must come at the\nexpense of competitors.\nIncreasing industry overcapacity: firm investment exceeds increases in demand.\nDeclining profitability: due to overcapacity.\nIncreased cost cutting: firms restructure to survive and attempt to build brand loyalty.\n\u2022 Increased failures: weaker firms liquidate or are acquired.\nIn the mature stage, there is little industry growth and firms begin to consolidate. The\ncharacteristics of this stage are as follows:\n\u2022 Slow growth: market is saturated and demand is only for replacement.\n\u2022 Consolidation: market evolves to an oligopoly.\nHigh barriers to entry: surviving firms have brand loyalty and low cost structures.\nStable pricing: firms try to avoid price wars, although periodic price wars may occur\nduring recessions.\nSuperior firms gain market share: the firms with better products may grow faster than\nthe industry average.\nIn the decline stage, industry growth is negative. The characteristics of this stage are as\nfollows:\n\u2022 Negative growth: due to development of substitute products, societal changes, or\nglobal competition.\nDeclining prices: competition is intense and there are price wars due to overcapacity.\nConsolidation: failing firms exit or merge.\nAn analyst should determine whether a firm is \u201cacting its age\u201d or stage of industry\ndevelopment. Growth firms should be reinvesting in operations in an attempt to increase\nproduct offerings, increase economies of scale, and build brand loyalty. They are not\nyet worried about cost efficiency. They should not pay out cash flows to investors but\nsave them for internal growth. On the other hand, mature firms focus on cost efficiency\nbecause demand is largely from replacement. They find few opportunities to introduce\nnew products. These firms should typically pay out cash to investors as dividends or\nstock repurchases because cash flows are strong but internal growth is limited. An analyst\nshould be concerned about firms that do not act their stage, such as a mature firm that is\ninvesting in low-return projects for the sake of increasing firm size.\nAlthough life-cycle analysis is a useful tool, industries do not always conform to its\nframework. Life-cycle stages may not be as long or short as anticipated, or they might\nbe skipped altogether. An industry's product may become obsolete quickly due to\ntechnological change, government regulation, societal change, or demographics. Lifecycle analysis is likely most useful during stable periods, not during periods of upheaval\nwhen conditions are changing rapidly. Furthermore, some firms will experience growth\nand profits that are dissimilar to others in their industries due to competitive advantages\nor disadvantages.\n"}
