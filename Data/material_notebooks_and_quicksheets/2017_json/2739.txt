{"id": 2739, "text": "5. Power of suppliers. Suppliers' ability to raise prices or limit supply influences industry\nprofitability. Suppliers are more powerful if there are just a few of them and their\nproducts are scarce. For example, Microsoft is one of the few suppliers of operating\nsystem software and thus has pricing power.\nThe first two forces deserve further attention because almost all firms must be concerned\nabout the threat of new entrants and competition that would erode profits. Studying\nthese forces also helps the analyst better understand the subject firm's competitors\nand prospects. The following summary describes how these two factors influence the\ncompetitive environment in an industry:\n\u2022 Higher barriers to entry reduce competition.\nGreater concentration (a small number of firms control a large part of the market)\nreduces competition, whereas market fragmentation (a large number of firms, each\nwith a small market share) increases competition.\nUnused capacity in an industry, especially if prolonged, results in intense price\ncompetition. For example, underutilized capacity in the auto industry has resulted in\nvery competitive pricing.\n1.
