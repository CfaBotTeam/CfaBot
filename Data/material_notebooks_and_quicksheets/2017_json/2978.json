{"id": 2978, "text": "Basic definitions. On the right (liability) side of a firm's balance sheet, we have debt,\npreferred stock, and common equity. These are normally referred to as the capital\ncomponents of the firm. Any increase in a firm's total assets will have to be financed\nthrough an increase in at least one of these capital accounts. The cost of each of these\ncomponents is called the component cost of capital.\nThroughout this review, we focus on the following capital components and their\ncomponent costs:\nThe rate at which the firm can issue new debt. This is the yield to\nmaturity on existing debt. This is also called the before-tax component\ncost of debt.\nka(1 - t) The after-tax cost of debt. Here, t is the firm's marginal tax rate. The aftertax component cost of debt, k (1 - t), is used to calculate the WACC.\n\u00a92016 Kaplan, Inc.\n"}
