{"id": "1395", "text": "Figure 20 illustrates how price discrimination can increase the total quantity supplied\nand increase economic profits compared to a single-price pricing strategy. For simplicity,\nwe have assumed no fixed costs and constant variable costs so that MC = ATC. In Panel\n(a), the single profit-maximizing price is $100 at a quantity of 80 (where MC = MR),\nwhich generates a profit of $2,400. In Panel (b), the firm is able to separate consumers,\ncharges one group $110 and sells them 50 units, and sells an additional 60 units to\nanother group (with more elastic demand) at a price of $90. Total profit is increased to\n$3,200, and total output is increased from 80 units to 110 units.\n"}
