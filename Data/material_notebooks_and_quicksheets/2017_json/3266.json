{"id": 3266, "text": "Profits and Cash Flows\nProfits and cash flows are needed to service debt. Here we examine four profit and cash.\nflow metrics commonly used in ratio analysis by credit analysts.\n1. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\nEBITDA is a commonly used measure that is calculated as operating income plus\ndepreciation and amortization. A drawback to using this measure for credit analysis\nis that it does not adjust for capital expenditures and changes in working capital,\nwhich are necessary uses of funds for a going concern. Cash needed for these uses is\nnot available to debt holders.\n"}
