{"id": 2561, "text": "An equal-weighted index is calculated as the arithmetic average return of the index\nstocks and, for a given time period, would be matched by the returns on a portfolio that\nhad equal dollar amounts invested in each index stock. As with a price-weighted index,\nan advantage of an equal-weighted index is its simplicity.\nOne complication with an equal-weighted index return is that a matching portfolio\nwould have to be adjusted periodically (rebalanced) as prices change so that the values of\nall security positions are made equal each period. The portfolio rebalancing required to\nmatch the performance of an equal-weighted index creates high transactions costs that\nwould decrease portfolio returns.\n"}
