A An indenture is the contract between the company and its bondholders and contains the\nbond's covenants.\n2. c Dual-currency bonds pay coupon interest in one currency and principal in a different\ncurrency. These currencies may or may not include the home currency of the issuer. A\ncurrency option bond allows the bondholder to choose a currency in which to be paid.\n3. A Requiring the issuer to comply with all laws and regulations is an example of an\naffirmative covenant. Negative covenants are restrictions on actions a bond issuer can\ntake. Examples include preventing an issuer from selling assets that have been pledged as\ncollateral or from issuing additional debt with an equal or higher priority of claims.\n4. B Tax authorities typically treat the increase in value of a pure-discount bond toward par\nas interest income to the bondholder. In many jurisdictions this interest income is taxed\nperiodically during the life of the bond even though the bondholder does not receive any\ncash until maturity.\n5. C This pattern describes a deferred-coupon bond. The first payment of $229.25 is the\nvalue of the accrued coupon payments for the first three years.\n6. B A cap is a maximum on the coupon rate and is advantageous to the issuer. A floor is a\nminimum on the coupon rate and is, therefore, advantageous to the bondholder.\n7. B Whenever the price of the bond increases above the strike price stipulated on the call\noption, it will be optimal for the issuer to call the bond. Theoretically, the price of a\ncurrently callable bond should never rise above its call price.\n"}
