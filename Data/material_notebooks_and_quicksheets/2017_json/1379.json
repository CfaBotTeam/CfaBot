{"id": "1379", "text": "either prisoner can improve his situation from silent/silent by confessing, because silent/\nconfess and confess/silent are preferred by each in turn. Neither of these outcomes is a\nNash equilibrium because the silent prisoner in both cases can improve his situation by\nconfessing rather than remaining silent. Confess/confess is the Nash equilibrium since\nneither prisoner can unilaterally reduce his sentence by changing to silence. Another way\nto view this outcome is that no matter what the other prisoner chooses to do, the best\nsentence for a prisoner comes from confessing.\n"}
