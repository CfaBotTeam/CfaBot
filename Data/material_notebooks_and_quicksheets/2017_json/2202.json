{"id": 2202, "text": "For a risk an organization has decided not to bear, risk transfer or risk shifting can be\nemployed. With a risk transfer, another party takes on the risk. Insurance is a type of\nrisk transfer. The risk of fire destroying a warehouse complex is shifted to an insurance\ncompany by buying an insurance policy and paying the policy premiums. Insurance\ncompanies diversify across many risks so the premiums of some insured parties pay the\nlosses of others. Ideally, the various risks the insurance company insures are not highly\ncorrelated, as that can reduce or eliminate any diversification benefits. An insurance\ncompany with highly correlated risks (or a single very large risk) may itself shift some of\nthe resulting risk by buying reinsurance from another company.\nWith a surety bond, an insurance company has agreed to make a payment if a third\nparty fails to perform under the terms of a contract or agreement with the organization.\nFor example, a company may be exposed to losses if a key supplier does not deliver on\ntime, slowing a project and resulting in penalty payments by the company. Insurers\nalso issue fidelity bonds, which will pay for losses that result from employee theft or\nmisconduct. Managements that purchase insurance, surety bonds, or fidelity bonds have\ndetermined that the benefits of risk reduction are greater than the cost of the insurance.\nRisk shifting is a way to change the distribution of possible outcomes and is\naccomplished primarily with derivative contracts. For example, financial firms that do\nnot want to bear currency risk on some foreign currency denominated debt securities\ncan use forward currency contracts, futures contracts, or swaps to reduce or eliminate\nthat risk. A firm with a large position in a specific stock can buy put options that provide\na minimum sale price for the securities, altering the distribution of possible outcomes\n(in this case providing a floor value for the securities). On the other hand, a firm could\nsell call options on a specific stock, altering the distribution of possible outcomes by\ngiving up some of the upside potential of the stock but decreasing its downside risk by\nthe amount of the premiums received from the sale of the call options.\n"}
