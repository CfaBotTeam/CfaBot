{"id": "359", "text": "With an initial stock price S = 50, U = 1.01, D = 401, and Prob(U) = 0.6, we can\ncalculate the possible stock prices after two periods as:\nuus =1.012 x 50 = 51.01 with probability (0.6)2 = 0.36\nuds =1.01%.01) x 50 = 50 with probability (0.6)(0.4) = 0.24\ndus = (%.01)(1.01)x50 = 50 with probability (0.4)(0.6) = 0.24\ndds = (.01x50 = 49.01 with probability (0.4)? = 0.16\nSince a stock price of 50 can result from either UD or DU moves, the probability of a\nstock price of 50 after two periods (the middle value) is 2 x (0.6)(0.4) = 48%.\nA binomial tree with S = 50, U = 1.1, and Prob(U) = 0.7 is illustrated in Figure 3.\nNote that the middle value after two periods (50) is equal to the beginning value. The\nprobability that the stock price is down (<50) after two periods is simply the probability\nof two down movements, (1 \u2013 0.7)2 = 9%.\n"}
