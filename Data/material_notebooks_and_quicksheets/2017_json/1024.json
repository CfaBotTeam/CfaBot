{"id": 1024, "text": "The inflation rate is decreasing, but the price level is still increasing. This is best\ndescribed as disinflation.\n6. C Core inflation is measured using a price index that excludes food and energy prices.\n7. C Adopting a chained price index method addresses substitution bias, as does using a\nPaasche index. Hedonic pricing adjusts for improvements in the quality of products over\ntime, not substitution bias.\n8. C Both inflation scenarios can involve a decrease in short-run aggregate supply due\nto increasing wage demands. In a wage-push scenario, which is a form of costpush inflation, the decrease in aggregate supply causes real GDP to fall below full\nemployment. In a demand-pull inflation scenario, an increase in aggregate demand\ncauses real GDP to increase beyond full employment, which creates wage pressure that\nresults in a decrease in short-run aggregate supply.\n9. A Lagging indicators have turning points that occur after business cycle turning points.\n"}
