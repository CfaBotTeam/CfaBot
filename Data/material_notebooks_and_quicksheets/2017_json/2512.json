{"id": 2512, "text": "An investment bank can also agree to distribute shares of an IPO on a best efforts basis,\nrather than agreeing to purchase the whole issue. If the issue is undersubscribed, the\nbank is not obligated to buy the unsold portion.\nNote that investment banks have a conflict of interest in an underwritten offer. As the\nissuer's agents, they should set the price high to raise the most funds for the issuer. But,\nas underwriters, they would prefer that the price be set low enough that the whole issue\nsells. This also allows them to allocate portions of an undervalued IPO to their clients.\nThis results in IPOs typically being underpriced. Issuers also could have an interest\nin underpricing the IPO because of the negative publicity when an undersubscribed\nIPO initially trades at a price below the IPO price investors pay. An IPO that is\noversubscribed and has the expectation of trading significantly above its IPO price is\nreferred to as a hot issue.\n"}
