{"id": 62, "text": "Pure discount instruments such as U.S. T-bills are quoted differently from U.S.\ngovernment bonds. T-bills are quoted on a bank discount basis, which is based on the face\nvalue of the instrument instead of the purchase price. The bank discount yield (BDY) is\ncomputed using the following formula:\nD 360\nFBD F*T\nwhere:\nFBD =\nthe annualized yield on a bank discount basis\nthe dollar discount, which is equal to the difference between the face value\nof the bill and the purchase price\nF = the face value (par value) of the bill\nt = number of days remaining until maturity\n360 = bank convention of number of days in a year\nThe key distinction of the bank discount yield is that it expresses the dollar discount\nfrom the face (par) value as a fraction of the face value, not the market price of the\ninstrument. Another notable feature of the bank discount yield is that it is annualized\nby multiplying the discount-to-par by 360/t, where the market convention is to use\na 360-day year versus a 365-day year. This type of annualizing method assumes no\ncompounding (i.e., simple interest).\n"}
