{"id": "2849", "text": "EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization are subtracted)\nis probably the most frequently used denominator for EV multiples; operating income\ncan also be used. Because the numerator represents total company value, it should be\ncompared to earnings of both debt and equity owners. An advantage of using EBITDA\ninstead of net income is that EBITDA is usually positive even when earnings are not.\nWhen net income is negative, value multiples based on earnings are meaningless. A\ndisadvantage of using EBITDA is that it often includes non-cash revenues and expenses.\nA potential problem with using enterprise value is that the market value of a firm's debt\nis often not available. In this case, the analyst can use the market values of similar bonds\nor can use their book values. Book value, however, may not be a good estimate of market\nvalue if firm and market conditions have changed significantly since the bonds were\nissued.\nExample: Calculating EV/EBITDA multiples\nDaniel, Inc., is a manufacturer of small refrigerators and other appliances. The\nfollowing figures are from Daniel's most recent financial statements except for the\nmarket value of long-term debt, which has been estimated from financial market data.\n"}
