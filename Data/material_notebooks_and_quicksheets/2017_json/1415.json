{"id": "1415", "text": "A second limitation that applies to both of our simple concentration measures is that\nbarriers to entry are not considered in either case. Even a firm with high market share\nmay not have much pricing power if barriers to entry are low and there is potential\ncompetition. With low barriers to entry, it may be the case that other firms stand ready to\nenter the market if firms currently in the market attempt to increase prices significantly.\nIn this case, the elasticity of demand for existing firms may be high even though they\nhave relatively high market shares and industry concentration measures.\n"}
