{"id": "3820", "text": "LOS 53.e\nMatrix pricing is a method used to estimate the yield-to-maturity for bonds that are not\ntraded or infrequently traded. The yield is estimated based on the yields of traded bonds\nwith the same credit quality. If these traded bonds have different maturities than the\nbond being valued, linear interpolation is used to estimate the subject bond's yield.\nLOS 53.f\nThe effective yield of a bond depends on its periodicity, or annual frequency of coupon\npayments. For an annual-pay bond the effective yield is equal to the yield-to-maturity.\nFor bonds with greater periodicity, the effective yield is greater than the yield-tomaturity.\n"}
