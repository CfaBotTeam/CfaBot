A notable example\nof such an arrangement is Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, currency is (and may be)\nonly issued when fully backed by holdings of an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority can earn interest on its U.S. dollar balances.\nWith dollarization, there is no such income, as the income is earned by the U.S.\nFederal Reserve when it buys interest-bearing assets with the U.S. currency it issues.\nWhile the monetary authority gives up the ability to conduct independent monetary\npolicy and essentially imports the inflation rate of the outside currency, there may be\nsome latitude to affect interest rates over the short term.\n"}
