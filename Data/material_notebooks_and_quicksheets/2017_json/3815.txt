{"id": 3815, "text": "To compute the Z-spread, set the present value of the bond's cash flows equal to today's\nmarket price. Discount each cash flow at the appropriate zero-coupon bond spot\nrate plus a fixed spread ZS. Solve for Zs in the following equation and you have the\nZ-spread:\n| 9\n109\n89.464 =\n(1.04 + zs)! (1.08167 + zs)?(1.12377 + ZS)\nzs = 1.67% or 167 basis points\nNote that this spread is found by trial-and-error. In other words, pick a number \u201cZs,\u201d\nplug it into the right-hand side of the equation, and see if the result equals 89.464. If\nthe right-hand side equals the left, then you have found the Z-spread. If not, adjust\n\u201cZs\" in the appropriate direction and recalculate.\n"}
