{"id": "1897", "text": "During inflationary periods and with stable or increasing inventory quantities, LIFO\nCOGS is higher than FIFO COGS. This is because the last units purchased have a\nhigher cost than the first units purchased. Under LIFO, the more costly last units\npurchased are assumed to be the first units sold (to COGS). Of course, higher COGS\nunder LIFO will result in lower gross profit and net income compared to FIFO.\n"}
