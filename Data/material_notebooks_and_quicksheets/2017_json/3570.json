{"id": "3570", "text": "Profits can be (1) any gains in value, (2) any gains in value in excess of the management\nfee, or (3) gains in excess of a hurdle rate. A hurdle rate can be set either as a percentage\n(e.g., 4%) or a rate plus a premium (e.g., Libor + 2%). A hard hurdle rate means that\nincentive fees are earned only on returns in excess of the benchmark. A soft hurdle rate\nmeans that incentive fees are paid on all profits, but only if the hurdle rate is met.\nAnother feature that is often included is called a high water mark. This means that the\nincentive fee is not paid on gains that just offset prior losses. Thus incentive fees are only\npaid to the extent that the current value of an investor's account is above the highest\nvalue after fees previously recorded. This feature ensures that investors will not be\ncharged incentive fees twice on the same gains in their portfolio values.\n"}
