{"id": 1498, "text": "We term the difference between GDP, and full-employment GDP in Figure 12 an\ninflationary gap because the increase in aggregate demand from its previous level causes\nupward pressure on the price level. Competition among producers for workers, raw\nmaterials, and energy may shift the SRAS curve to the left, returning the economy to\nfull-employment GDP but at a price level that is higher still. Alternatively, government\npolicy makers can reduce aggregate demand by decreasing government spending,\nincreasing taxes, or slowing the growth rate of the money supply, in order to move the\neconomy back to the initial long run equilibrium at full-employment GDP.\n"}
