{"id": "681", "text": "Triangles suggest buying and selling pressure have become roughly equal temporarily,\nbut they do not imply a change in direction of the trend. The size of a triangle, or the\ndifference between the two trendlines at the time when the pattern begins to form,\ncan be used to set a price target, assuming the price breaks out of the triangle and the\nprevious trend continues.\nRectangles form when trading temporarily forms a range between a support level and a\nresistance level. As with a triangle, a rectangle suggests the prevailing trend will resume\nand can be used to set a price target. Flags and pennants refer to rectangles and triangles\nthat appear on short-term price charts.\n"}
