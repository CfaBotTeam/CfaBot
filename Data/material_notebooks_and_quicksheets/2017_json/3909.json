{"id": 3909, "text": "The cash flow to a pool of credit card receivables includes finance charges, annual fees,\nand principal repayments. Credit cards have periodic payment schedules, but because\ntheir balances are revolving (i.e., non-amortizing), the principal amount is maintained\nfor a period of time. Interest on credit card ABS is paid periodically, but no principal is\npaid to the ABS holders during the lockout period, which may last from 18 months to\n10 years after the ABS are created.\nIf the underlying credit card holders make principal payments during the lockout period,\nthese payments are used to purchase additional credit card receivables, keeping the\noverall value of the receivables pool relatively constant. Once the lockout period ends,\nprincipal payments are passed through to security holders. Credit card ABS typically\nhave an early (rapid) amortization provision that provides for earlier amortization of\nprincipal when it is necessary to preserve the credit quality of the securities.\n"}
