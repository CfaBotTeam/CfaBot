{"id": 3338, "text": "Futures contracts are similar to forward contracts in that both;\nCan be either deliverable or cash-settled contracts.\nHave contract prices set so each side of the contract has a value of zero value at the\ninitiation of the contract.\nFutures contracts differ from forward contracts in the following ways:\nFutures contracts trade on organized exchanges. Forwards are private contracts and\ntypically do not trade.\nFutures contracts are standardized. Forwards are customized contracts satisfying the\nspecific needs of the parties involved.\nA clearinghouse is the counterparty to all futures contracts. Forwards are contracts\nwith the originating counterparty and therefore have counterparty (credit) risk.\nThe government regulates futures markets. Forward contracts are usually not\nregulated and do not trade in organized markets.\nA major difference between forwards and futures is futures contracts have standardized\ncontract terms. For each commodity or financial asset, listed futures contracts specify\nthe quality and quantity of assets required under the contract and the delivery procedure\n(for deliverable contracts). The exchange sets the minimum price fluctuation (called the\ntick size), daily price move limit, the settlement date, and the trading times for each\ncontract.\n"}
