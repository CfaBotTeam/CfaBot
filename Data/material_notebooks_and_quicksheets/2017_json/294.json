{"id": 294, "text": "There are five guidelines that may be used to determine which counting method to\nemploy when dealing with counting problems:\n\u2022 The multiplication rule of counting is used when there are two or more groups. The key\nis that only one item may be selected from each group. If there are k steps required to\ncomplete a task and each step can be done in n ways, the number of different ways\nto complete the task is n! x ng! * ... * ng'.\nFactorial is used by itself when there are no groups\u2014we are only arranging a given set\nof n items. Given n items, there are n! ways of arranging them.\nThe labeling formula applies to three or more sub-groups of predetermined size. Each\nelement of the entire group must be assigned a place, or label, in one of the three or\nmore sub-groups.\nThe combination formula applies to only two groups of predetermined size. Look for\nthe word \"choose\u201d or \u201ccombination.\"\nThe permutation formula applies to only two groups of predetermined size. Look for a\nspecific reference to \u201corder\u201d being important.\n"}
