{"id": 3174, "text": "Other things equal, an increase (decrease) in a bond's YTM will decrease (increase) its\ninterest rate risk. To understand this, we can look to the convexity of the price-yield\ncurve and use its slope as our proxy for interest rate risk. At lower yields, the price-yield\ncurve has a steeper slope indicating that price is more sensitive to a given change in\nyield.\n"}
