If it were possible for the monopolist to charge each consumer the\nmaximum they are willing to pay for each unit, there would be no deadweight loss\nbecause a monopolist would produce the same quantity as under perfect competition.\nWith perfect price discrimination, there would be no consumer surplus. It would all be\ncaptured by the monopolist.\n"}
