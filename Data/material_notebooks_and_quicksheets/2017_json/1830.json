{"id": "1830", "text": "Diluted EPS is a \u201cwhat if\u201d value. It is calculated to be the lowest possible EPS that could\nhave been reported if all firm securities that can be converted into common stock, and\nthat would decrease basic EPS if they had been, were converted. That is, if all dilutive\nsecurities had been converted. Potentially dilutive securities include convertible debt and\nconvertible preferred stock, as well as options and warrants issued by the company. The\nnumerator of diluted EPS is increased by the after-tax interest savings on any dilutive\ndebt securities and by the dividends on any dilutive convertible preferred stock. The\ndenominator is increased by the common shares that would result from conversion or\nexchange of dilutive securities into common shares.\n"}
