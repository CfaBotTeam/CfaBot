{"id": 3758, "text": "Consider a case where we are estimating the value of a 5-year, 5% annual-pay coupon\nbond and have the YTMs of otherwise very similar bonds with 4-year and 7-year\nmaturities, 4.738% and 5.336%, respectively. In this case, we estimate the YTM on the\n5-year bond as the yield on the 4-year bond, plus one-third of the difference between\nthe YTM of the 4-year bond and the YTM of the 7-year bond. Note that the difference\nin maturity between the 4-year bond and the 5-year bond is one year and the difference\nbetween the maturities of the 4-year and 7-year bonds is three years.\n"}
