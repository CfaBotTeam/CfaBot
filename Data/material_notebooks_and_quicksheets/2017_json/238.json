{"id": 238, "text": "Here, E is referred to as the expectations operator and is used to indicate the\ncomputation of a probability-weighted average. The symbol x, represents the first\nobserved value (observation) for random variable X, x, is the second observation, and so\non, through the nth observation. The concept of expected value may be demonstrated\nusing the a priori probabilities associated with a coin toss. On the flip of one coin, the\noccurrence of the event \u201cheads\u201d may be used to assign the value of one to a random\nvariable. Alternatively, the event \u201ctails\u201d means the random variable equals zero.\nStatistically, we would formally write:\n"}
