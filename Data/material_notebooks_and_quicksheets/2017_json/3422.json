If there\nwere no volatility in the price of the underlying asset (its price remained constant),\noptions would always be equal to their intrinsic values and time or speculative value\nwould be zero. An increase in the volatility of the price of the underlying asset\nincreases the values of both put and call options and a decrease in volatility of the\nprice of the underlying decreases both put values and call values.\n"}
