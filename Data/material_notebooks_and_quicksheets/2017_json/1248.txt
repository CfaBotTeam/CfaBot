{"id": 1248, "text": "Now, let's build on the first example by examining the arbitrage opportunity when the\nforward rate does not satisfy the equation that describes interest rate parity between two\ncurrencies. Consider a forward rate of 4.6000 so that the depreciation in the ABE is\nless than that implied by interest rate parity. This makes the ABE attractive to a DUB\ninvestor who can earn a riskless profit as follows:\n\u2022 Borrow 1,000 DUB for one year at 3% to purchase ABE and get 4,567.1 ABE.\nInvest the 4,567.1 ABE at the ABE rate of 5% to have 1.05(4,567.1) = 4,795.45\nABE at the end of one year.\nEnter into a currency forward contract to exchange 4,795.45 ABE in one year at the\nforward rate of 4.6000 ABE/DUB in order to receive 4,795.45 | 4.6000 = 1,042.49\nDUB.\nThe investor has ended the year with a 4.249% return on his 1,000 DUB investment,\nwhich is higher than the 3% 1-year DUB interest rate. After repaying the 1,000 DUB\nloan plus interest (1,030 DUB), the investor has a profit of 1,042.49 \u2013 1,030 = 12.49\nDUB with no risk and no initial out-of-pocket investment (i.e., a pure arbitrage profit).\n"}
