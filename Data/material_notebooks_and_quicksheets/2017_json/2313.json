{"id": "2313", "text": "Systematic Risk is Relevant in Portfolios\nOne important conclusion of capital market theory is that equilibrium security returns\ndepend on a stock's or a portfolio's systematic risk, not its total risk as measured by\nstandard deviation. One of the assumptions of the model is that diversification is free.\nThe reasoning is that investors will not be compensated for bearing risk that can be\neliminated at no cost. If you think about the costs of a no-load index fund compared to\nbuying individual stocks, diversification is actually very low cost if not actually free.\nThe implications of this conclusion are very important to asset pricing (expected\nreturns). The riskiest stock, with risk measured as standard deviation of returns, does\nnot necessarily have the greatest expected return. Consider a biotech stock with one new\ndrug product that is in clinical trials to determine its effectiveness. If it turns out that\nthe drug is effective and safe, stock returns will be quite high. If, on the other hand, the\nsubjects in the clinical trials are killed or otherwise harmed by the drug, the stock will\nfall to approximately zero and returns will be quite poor. This describes a stock with\nhigh standard deviation of returns (i.e., high total risk).\n"}
