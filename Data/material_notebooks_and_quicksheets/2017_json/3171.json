{"id": "3171", "text": "Recall that duration is an adequate measure of bond price risk only for parallel shifts in\nthe yield curve. The impact of nonparallel shifts can be measured using a concept known\nas key rate duration. A key rate duration, also known as a partial duration, is defined as\nthe sensitivity of the value of a bond or portfolio to changes in the spot rate for a specific\nmaturity, holding other spot rates constant. A bond or portfolio will have a key rate\nduration for each maturity range on the spot rate curve.\nKey rate duration is particularly useful for measuring the effect of a nonparallel shift in\nthe yield curve on a bond portfolio. We can use the key rate duration for each maturity\nto compute the effect on the portfolio of the interest rate change at that maturity. The\neffect on the overall portfolio is the sum of these individual effects.\n"}
