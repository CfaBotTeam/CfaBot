C The capital market line (CML) plots return against total risk which is measured by\nstandard deviation of returns.\n3. B A portfolio to the right of a portfolio on the CML has more risk than the market\nportfolio. Investors seeking to take on more risk will borrow at the risk-free rate to\npurchase more of the market portfolio.\n4. A When you increase the number of stocks in a portfolio, unsystematic risk will decrease\nat a decreasing rate. However, the portfolio's systematic risk can be increased by adding\nhigher-beta stocks or decreased by adding lower-beta stocks.\n5. c Total risk equals systematic plus unsystematic risk. Unique risk is diversifiable and is\nunsystematic. Market (systematic) risk is nondiversifiable risk.\nMacroeconomic, fundamental, and statistical factor exposures can be included in a\nreturn generating model to estimate the expected return of an investment. However,\nstatistical factors may not have any theoretical basis, so analysts prefer macroeconomic\nand fundamental factor models.\n7. C Beta = covariance / market variance\nMarket variance = 0.052 = 0.0025\nBeta = 0.005 / 0.0025 = 2.0\n"}
