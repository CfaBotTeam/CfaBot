{"id": 455, "text": "Example: Standard error of sample mean (unknown population variance)\nContinuing with our example, suppose that instead of a sample size of 30, we take a\nsample of the past 200 monthly returns for McCreary, Inc. In order to highlight the\neffect of sample size on the sample standard error, let's assume that the mean return\nand standard deviation of this larger sample remain at 2% and 20%, respectively.\nNow, calculate the standard error of the sample mean for the 200-return sample.\n"}
