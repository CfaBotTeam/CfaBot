{"id": "1571", "text": "This movement of discouraged workers out of and back into the labor force causes the\nunemployment rate to be a lagging indicator of the business cycle. Early in an expansion\nwhen hiring prospects begin to improve, the number of discouraged workers who reenter the labor force is greater than the number who are hired immediately. This causes\nthe unemployment rate to increase even though employment is expanding. To gauge\nthe current state of the labor market, analysts should include other widely available\nindicators such as the number of employees on payrolls.\nEarlier, we noted that firms tend to be slow to hire or lay off workers at business cycle\nturning points. This also causes the unemployment rate to lag the business cycle. The\neffect can also be seen in data on productivity, or output per hour worked. Productivity\ndeclines early in contractions as firms try to keep employees on despite producing less\noutput. Productivity increases early in expansions as firms try to produce more output\nbut are not yet ready to hire new workers.\n"}
