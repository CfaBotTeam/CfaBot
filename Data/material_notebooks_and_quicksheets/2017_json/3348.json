{"id": "3348", "text": "Swaps are agreements to exchange a series of payments on periodic settlement dates\nover a certain time period (e.g., quarterly payments over two years). At each settlement date, the two payments are netted so that only one (net) payment is made. The\nparty with the greater liability makes a payment to the other party. The length of the\nswap is termed the tenor of the swap and the contract ends on the termination date.\nSwaps are similar to forwards in several ways:\nSwaps typically require no payment by either party at initiation.\nSwaps are custom instruments.\nSwaps are not traded in any organized secondary market.\nSwaps are largely unregulated.\nDefault risk is an important aspect of the contracts.\nMost participants in the swaps market are large institutions.\n\u2022 Individuals are rarely swaps market participants.\nThere are swaps facilitators who bring together parties with needs for the opposite sides\nof swaps. There are also dealers, large banks, and brokerage firms who act as principals in\ntrades just as they do in forward contracts.\n"}
