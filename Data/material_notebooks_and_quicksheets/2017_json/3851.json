{"id": "3851", "text": "Note that the SPE is a separate legal entity from Fred and the buyers of the ABS have\nno claim on other assets of Fred, only on the loans sold to the SPE. If Fred had issued\ncorporate bonds to raise the funds to make more auto loans, the bondholders would be\nsubject to the financial risks of Fred. With the ABS structure, a decline in the financial\nposition of Fred, its ability to make cash payments, or its bond rating do not affect\nthe value of the claims of ABS owners to the cash flows from the trust collateral (loan\nportfolio) because it has been sold by Fred, which is now simply the servicer (not the\nowner) of the loans. The credit rating of the ABS securities may be higher than the\ncredit rating of bonds issued by Fred, in which case the cost to fund the loans using the\nABS structure is lower than if Fred funded additional loans by issuing corporate bonds.\n"}
