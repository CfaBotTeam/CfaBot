{"id": "224", "text": "Example: Addition rule of probability\nUsing the information in our previous interest rate and recession example and the\nfact that the unconditional probability of a recession, P(R), is 34%, determine the\nprobability that either interest rates will increase or a recession will occur.\nAnswer:\nGiven that P(R) = 0.34, P(I) = 0.40, and P(RI) = 0.28, we can compute P(R or I) as\nfollows:\n"}
