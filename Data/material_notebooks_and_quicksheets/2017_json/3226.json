The value of the call option:\nA. increases when YTM increases.\nB. decreases when YTM increases.\nC. decreases when bond price increases.\nWhich of the following measures is lowest for a callable bond?\nA. Macaulay duration.\nB. Effective duration.\nC. Modified duration.\nThe modified duration of a bond is 7.87. The approximate percentage change in\nprice using duration only for a yield decrease of 110 basis points is closest to:\nA. -8.657%.\nB. +7.155%.\nC. +8.657%.\nA bond has a convexity of 114.6. The convexity effect, if the yield decreases by\n110 basis points, is closest to:\nA. -1.673%.\nB. +0.693%.\nC. +1.673%.\nAssume a bond has an effective duration of 10.5 and a convexity of 97.3. Using\nboth of these measures, the estimated percentage change in price for this bond,\nin response to a decline in yield of 200 basis points, is closest to:\nA. 19.05%.\nB. 22.95%.\nC. 24.89%.\n"}
