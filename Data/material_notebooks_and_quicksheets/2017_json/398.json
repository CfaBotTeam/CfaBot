{"id": 398, "text": "Monte Carlo simulation is a technique based on the repeated generation of one or more\nrisk factors that affect security values, in order to generate a distribution of security\nvalues. For each of the risk factors, the analyst must specify the parameters of the\nprobability distribution that the risk factor is assumed to follow. A computer is then\nused to generate random values for each risk factor based on its assumed probability\ndistributions. Each set of randomly generated risk factors is used with a pricing model\nto value the security. This procedure is repeated many times (100s, 1,000s, or 10,000s),\nand the distribution of simulated asset values is used to draw inferences about the\nexpected (mean) value of the security and possibly the variance of security values about\nthe mean as well.\n"}
