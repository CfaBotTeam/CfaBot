{"id": "2265", "text": "In our previous illustration of efficient portfolios available in the market, we included\nonly risky assets. Now we will introduce a risk-free asset into our universe of available\nassets, and we will consider the risk and return characteristics of a portfolio that\ncombines a portfolio of risky assets and the risk-free asset. Recall from Quantitative\nMethods that we can calculate the expected return and standard deviation of a portfolio\nwith weight W, allocated to risky Asset A and weight W, allocated to risky Asset B using\nthe following formulas:\nE(Rportfolio) = WAE(R) + WGE(R3)\n"}
