{"id": 3395, "text": "Rather than enter into an FRA, a bank can create the same payment structure with two\nLibor loans, a synthetic FRA. A bank can borrow money for 120 days and lend that\namount for 30 days. At the end of 30 days, the bank receives funds from the repayment\nof the 30-day loan it made, and has use of these funds for the next 90 days at an effective\nrate determined by the original transactions. The effective rate of interest on this 90day loan depends on both 30-day Libor and 120-day Libor at the time the money is\nborrowed and loaned to the third party. This rate is the contract rate on a 30-day FRA\non 90-day Libor. The resulting cash flows will be the same with either the FRA or the\nsynthetic FRA.\n"}
