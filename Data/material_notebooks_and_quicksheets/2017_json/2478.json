{"id": "2478", "text": "In 2003, the U.S. SEC mandated that U.S.-registered mutual funds institute policies\nand procedures to ensure that the proxies they hold for investors in their funds are\nvoted in the best interests of fund investors. Prior to this, many funds that held shares\nfor investors failed to devote resources to fulfill their responsibility to vote proxies.\nU.S. funds are also required to disclose their proxy voting records.\nOverall, the increased focus on the importance of good corporate governance has given\nrise to a new industry focused on corporate governance, which includes firms that\nadvise funds on proxy voting and corporate governance matters. Firms that provide\nratings of companies' corporate governance practices offer another avenue to influence\nmanagements to better address the interests of shareholders.\n"}
