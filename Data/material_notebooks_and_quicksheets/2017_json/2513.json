{"id": "2513", "text": "Primary Market: Private Placements and Other Transactions\nIn a private placement, securities are sold directly to qualified investors, typically with\nthe assistance of an investment bank. Qualified investors are those with substantial\nwealth and investment knowledge. Private placements do not require the issuer to\ndisclose as much information as they must when the securities are being sold to the\npublic. The issuance costs are less with a private placement and the offer price is also\nlower because the securities cannot be resold in public markets, making them less\nvaluable than shares registered for public trading.\nIn a shelf registration, a firm makes its public disclosures as in a regular offering but\nthen issues the registered securities over time when it needs capital and when the\nmarkets are favorable.\n"}
