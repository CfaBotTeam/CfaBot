{"id": 3235, "text": "Credit risk is the risk associated with losses stemming from the failure of a borrower to\nmake timely and full payments of interest or principal. Credit risk has two components:\ndefault risk and loss severity.\nDefault risk is the probability that a borrower (bond issuer) fails to pay interest or\nrepay principal when due.\nLoss severity, or loss given default, refers to the value a bond investor will lose if the\nissuer defaults. Loss severity can be stated as a monetary amount or as a percentage\nof a bond's value (principal and unpaid interest).\nThe expected loss is equal to the default risk multiplied by the loss severity. Expected\nloss can likewise be stated as a monetary value or as a percentage of a bond's value.\n"}
