{"id": 1668, "text": "Cash flow from operations is presented differently under the indirect method, but the\namount of CFO is the same under either method. Cash flow from financing and cash\nflow from investing are presented in the same way on cash flow statements prepared\nunder both the direct and indirect methods of presenting the statement of cash flows.\nUnder the indirect method of presenting CFO, we begin with net income and\nadjust it for differences between accounting items and actual cash receipts and cash\ndisbursements. Depreciation, for example, is deducted in calculating net income, but\nrequires no cash outlay in the current period. Therefore, we must add depreciation (and\namortization) to net income for the period in calculating CFO.\n"}
