The remaining $60,000 is\nborrowed. The commission on the purchase is 1,000 x $0.05 = $50. Thus, the\ntotal initial equity investment is $40,050.\nAt the end of one year, the stock value is 1,000 x $110 = $110,000, for a gain of\n$9,950. Dividends received are 1,000 x $2.00 = $2,000. Interest paid is $60,000 x\n4% = $2,400. The commission on the sale is 1,000 x $0.05 = $50.\nThe gain on the transaction in one year is $9,950 + $2,000 - $2,400 \u2013 $50 = $9,500.\nThe return on the equity investment is $9,500 / $40,050 = 23.72%. The investor's\nnet return is less than the asset total return (10% price appreciation + 2% dividend =\n12%) multiplied by the leverage ratio (12% x 2.5 = 30%) because of the loan interest\nand commissions.\nWe can also solve for the return on the margin transaction with the cash flow\nfunctions on a financial calculator. The initial cash outflow is the $40,000 initial\nmargin + $50 purchase commission = $40,050. The inflow after one year is the\n$110,000 stock value + $2,000 dividends \u2013 $60,000 margin repayment - $2,400\nmargin interest \u2013 $50 sale commission = $49,550. Using the cash flow functions: CF,\n= -40,050; CF, = 49,550; CPT IRR = 23.72%.\n"}
