{"id": "3255", "text": "Collateral\nCollateral analysis is more important for less creditworthy companies. The market\nvalue of a company's assets can be difficult to observe directly. Issues to consider when\nassessing collateral values include:\n\u2022 Intangible assets. Patents are considered high-quality intangible assets because they\ncan be more easily sold to generate cash flows than other intangibles. Goodwill is\nnot considered a high-quality intangible asset and is usually written down when\ncompany performance is poor.\nDepreciation. High depreciation expense relative to capital expenditures may signal\nthat management is not investing sufficiently in the company. The quality of the\ncompany's assets may be poor, which may lead to reduced operating cash flow and\npotentially high loss severity.\nEquity market capitalization. A stock that trades below book value may indicate\nthat company assets are of low quality.\nHuman and intellectual capital. These are difficult to value, but a company may\nhave intellectual property that can function as collateral.\n"}
