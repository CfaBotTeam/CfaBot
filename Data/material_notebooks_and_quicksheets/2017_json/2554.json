{"id": 2554, "text": "Company ownership and voting structure\nVoting control of companies is typically proportional to share ownership because each\nshare entitles its holder to one vote. In a dual class structure, one class of shares may be\nentitled to several votes per share, while another class of shares is entitled to one vote\nper share. This structure is often used to ensure that founding shareholders (and, later,\ntheir heirs) can maintain control of the board of directors even when their economic\nownership is significantly less than 50%. Companies with a dual-class share structure\nhave traded, on average, at a discount to comparable companies with a single class of\nshares.\n"}
