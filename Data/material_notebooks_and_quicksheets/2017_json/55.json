{"id": "55", "text": "Time-weighted rate of return measures compound growth. It is the rate at which $1\ncompounds over a specified performance horizon. Time-weighting is the process of\naveraging a set of values over time. The annual time-weighted return for an investment\nmay be computed by performing the following steps:\nStep 1: Value the portfolio immediately preceding significant additions or withdrawals.\nForm subperiods over the evaluation period that correspond to the dates of\ndeposits and withdrawals.\nStep 2: Compute the holding period return (HPR) of the portfolio for each subperiod.\nStep 3: Compute the product of (1 + HPR) for each subperiod to obtain a total return\nfor the entire measurement period (i.e., (1 + HPR,) x (1 + HPR,) ...\n(1 + HPR )). If the total investment period is greater than one year, you must\ntake the geometric mean of the measurement period return to find the annual\ntime-weighted rate of return.\n"}
