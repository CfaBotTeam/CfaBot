{"id": 2640, "text": "Other Anomalies\nClosed-end investment funds. The shares of closed-end investment funds trade at\nprices that sometimes deviate from the net asset value (NAV) of the fund shares, often\ntrading at large discounts to NAV. Such large discounts are an anomaly because, by\narbitrage, the value of the pool of assets should be the same as the market price for\nclosed-end shares. Various explanations have been put forth to explain this anomaly,\nincluding management fees, taxes on future capital gains, and share illiquidity. None of\nthese explanations fully explains the pricing discrepancy. However, transactions costs\nwould eliminate any profits from exploiting the unexplained portion of closed-end fund\ndiscounts.\n"}
