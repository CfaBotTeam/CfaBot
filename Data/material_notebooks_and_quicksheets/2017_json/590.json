{"id": "590", "text": "For an example of a paired comparisons test, consider a test of whether the returns on\ntwo steel firms were equal over a 5-year period. We can't use the difference in means test\nbecause we have reason to believe that the samples are not independent. To some extent,\nboth will depend on the returns on the overall market (market risk) and the conditions\nin the steel industry (industry specific risk). In this case, our pairs will be the returns\non each firm over the same time periods, so we use the differences in monthly returns\nfor the two companies. The paired comparisons test is just a test of whether the average\ndifference between monthly returns is significantly different from zero, based on the\nstandard error of the differences in monthly returns.\n"}
