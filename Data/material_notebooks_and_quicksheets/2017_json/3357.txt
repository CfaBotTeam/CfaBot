{"id": 3357, "text": "Arbitrage is an important concept in valuing (pricing) derivative securities. In its purest\nsense, arbitrage is riskless. If a return greater than the risk-free rate can be earned by\nholding a portfolio of assets that produces a certain (riskless) return, then an arbitrage\nopportunity exists.\nArbitrage opportunities arise when assets are mispriced. Trading by arbitrageurs will\ncontinue until they affect supply and demand enough to bring asset prices to efficient\n(no-arbitrage) levels.\nThere are two arbitrage arguments that are particularly useful in the study and use of\nderivatives.\nThe first is based on the law of one price. Two securities or portfolios that have identical\ncash flows in the future, regardless of future events, should have the same price. If A and\nB have the identical future payoffs and A is priced lower than B, buy A and sell B. You\nhave an immediate profit, and the payoff on A will satisfy the (future) liability of being\nshort on B.\n"}
