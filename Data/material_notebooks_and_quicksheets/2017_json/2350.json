A shareholder who does not attend the annual general meeting can vote\nher shares by proxy, meaning she assigns her right to vote to another who will attend\nthe meeting, often a director, member of management, or the shareholder's investment\nadvisor. A proxy may specify the shareholder's vote on specific issues or leave the vote to\nthe discretion of the person to whom the proxy is assigned.\nOrdinary resolutions, such as approval of auditor and the election of directors, require a\nsimple majority of the votes cast. Other resolutions, such as those regarding a merger or\ntakeover, or that require amendment of corporate bylaws, are termed special resolutions\nand may require a supermajority vote for passage, typically two-thirds or three-fourths\nof the votes cast. Such special resolutions can also be addressed at extraordinary general\nmeetings, which can be called anytime there is a resolution about a matter that requires\na vote of the shareholders.\n"}
