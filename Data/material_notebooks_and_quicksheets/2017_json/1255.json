{"id": "1255", "text": "A Giffen good is an inferior good for which the negative income effect outweighs the\npositive substitution effect when price falls, as in Panel (c) of Figure 3. A Giffen good is\ntheoretical and would have an upward-sloping demand curve. At lower prices, a smaller\nquantity would be demanded as a result of the dominance of the income effect over\nthe substitution effect. Note that the existence of a Giffen good is not ruled out by the\naxioms of the theory of consumer choice.\nA Veblen good is one for which a higher price makes the good more desirable. The idea\nis that the consumer gets utility from being seen to consume a good that has high status\n(e.g., Gucci bag), and that a higher price for the good conveys more status and increases\nits utility. Such a good could conceivably have a positively sloped demand curve for\nsome individuals over some range of prices. If such a good exists, there must be a limit\nto this process, or the price would rise without limit. Note that the existence of a Veblen\ngood does violate the theory of consumer choice. If a Veblen good exists, it is not an\ninferior good, so both the substitution and income effects of a price increase are to\ndecrease consumption of the good.\n"}
