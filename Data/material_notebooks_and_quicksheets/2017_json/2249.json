{"id": "2249", "text": "The variance of returns for a portfolio of two risky assets is calculated as follows:\nVarportfolio = wio\u0164 + wzo3 + 2wi wzCov12\nwhere w, is the proportion of the portfolio invested in Asset 1, and w, is the proportion\nof the portfolio invested in Asset 2. w, must equal (1 -- wy).\nPreviously, we established that the correlation of returns for two assets is calculated as:\n12, so that we can also write Cov12 = P20102.\n0102\nSubstituting this term for Cov,2 in the formula for the variance of returns for a portfolio\nof two risky assets, we have the following:\nVar ortfolio = wio\u0164 + w\u017eo\u017e + 2w, W2020102\n"}
