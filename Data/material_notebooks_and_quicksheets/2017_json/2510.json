{"id": "2510", "text": "Primary Market: Public Offerings\nCorporate stock or bond issues are almost always sold with the assistance of an\ninvestment banking firm. The investment bank finds investors who agree to buy part of\nthe issue. These are not actual orders but are referred to as indications of interest. When\nthe number of shares covered by indications of interest are greater (less) than the number\nof shares to be offered, the offering price may be adjusted upward (downward). This\nprocess of gathering indications of interest is referred to as book building. In London,\nthe book builder is referred to as the book runner. In Europe, an accelerated book build\noccurs when securities must be issued quickly. To build a book, the investment bank\ndisseminates information about the firm's financials and prospects. The issuer must also\nmake disclosures including how the funds will be used.\n"}
