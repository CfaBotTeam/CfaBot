{"id": 3383, "text": "In contrast to the value of a futures or forward position, the price of a futures or forward\ncontract refers to the futures or forward price specified in the contract. As an example of\nthis difference, consider a long position in a forward contract to buy the underlying asset\nin the future at $50, which is the forward contract price. At initiation of the contract,\nthe value is zero but the contract price is $50. If the expected future value of the\nunderlying asset increases, the value of the long contract position will increase (and the\nvalue of the short position will decrease by a like amount). The contract price at which\nthe long forward can purchase the asset in the future remains the same. If a new forward\ncontract were now created it would have a zero value, but a higher forward price that\nreflects the higher expected future value of the underlying asset.\n"}
