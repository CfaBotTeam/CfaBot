{"id": 227, "text": "In our interest rate and recession example, recall that events I and R are not\nindependent; the occurrence of I affects the probability of the occurrence of R. In this\nexample, the independence conditions for I and R are violated because:\nP(R) = 0.34, but P(R| I) = 0.7; the probability of a recession is greater when there is\nan increase in interest rates.\n"}
