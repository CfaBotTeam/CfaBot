{"id": "284", "text": "In the figure above, we have multiplied the probabilities to calculate the probabilities\nof each of the four outcome pairs. Note that these sum to 1. Given that the stock has\ngains, what is our updated probability of an outperforming economy? We sum the\nprobability of stock gains in both states (outperform and underperform) to get 42%\n+ 8% = 50%. Given that the stock has gains, the probability that the economy has\noutperformed is ze = 84%. In the previous notation the priors are as follows:\n50%\nprobability of economic outperformance = P(O) = 60%, the probability of stock\ngains given economic outperformance is P(G| 0) = 70%, and the (unconditional)\nprobability of a gain in stock price is 50%.\nWe are seeking P(O| G), the probability of outperformance given gains. Bayes'\nformula says:\nC_P(G|0}xP(O) 42%\nwhich is our = 84%\n"}
