{"id": 1116, "text": "Additional macroeconomic issues may hinder usefulness of fiscal policy:\nMisreading economic statistics: The full employment level for an economy is\nnot precisely measurable. If the government relies on expansionary fiscal policy\nmistakenly at a time when the economy is already at full capacity, it will simply drive\ninflation higher.\nCrowding-out effect: Expansionary fiscal policy may crowd out private investment,\nreducing the impact on aggregate demand.\nSupply shortages: If economic activity is slow due to resource constraints (low\navailability of labor or other resources) and not due to low demand, expansionary\nfiscal policy will fail to achieve its objective and will probably lead to higher\ninflation.\nLimits to deficits: There is a limit to expansionary fiscal policy. If the markets\nperceive that the deficit is already too high as a proportion of GDP, funding the\ndeficit will be problematic. This could lead to higher interest rates and actually make\nthe situation worse.\nMultiple targets: If the economy has high unemployment coupled with high\ninflation, fiscal policy cannot address both problems simultaneously.\n"}
