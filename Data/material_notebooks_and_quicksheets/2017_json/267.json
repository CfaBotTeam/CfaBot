{"id": 267, "text": "Example: Variance of a 3-asset portfolio\nA portfolio composed of risky assets A, B, and C will have a variance of return\ndetermined as:\nVar(R,= WAWACov(RARA) + WAWBCov(RA, Rg) + wawcCov(RAR)\n+ wgwaCov(R3,RA) + wgwgCov(R3,R3) + wgwcCov(R3,R)\n+ WCWA Cov(R,R) + w.wgCov(R,R2) + wcwcCov(R,R)\nwhich can be reduced to the following expression:\nVar(R) = w\u00bao?(R) + wg\u00b0o?(R,) + wo\u0142o(R)\n+ 2w.wgCov(R,,Rg) + 2wawcCov(RAR) + 2w3wcCov(R3,R)\nA portfolio composed of four assets will have four w\u0142o?(R,) terms and six\n2w;w;Cov(R,R) terms. A portfolio with five assets will have five w\u0142o?(R;) terms\nand ten 2w:w;\u0106ov(R,R) terms. In fact, the expression for the variance of an n-asset\nportfolio will have n(n - 1)/2 unique Cov(R,R) terms since Cov(R,R) = Cov(R,R).\n"}
