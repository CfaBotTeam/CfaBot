{"id": 1644, "text": "Recall from Figure 1 that under U.S. GAAP, dividends paid to the firm's shareholders\nare reported as financing activities while interest paid is reported in operating activities.\nInterest received and dividends received from investments are also reported as operating\nactivities.\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) allow more flexibility in the\nclassification of cash flows. Under IFRS, interest and dividends received may be classified\nas either operating or investing activities. Dividends paid to the company's shareholders\nand interest paid on the company's debt may be classified as either operating or\nfinancing activities.\nAnother important difference relates to income taxes paid. Under U.S. GAAP, all taxes\npaid are reported as operating activities, even taxes related to investing and financing\ntransactions. Under IFRS, income taxes are also reported as operating activities unless\nthe expense is associated with an investing or financing transaction.\nFor example, consider a company that sells land that was held for investment for\n$1 million. Income taxes on the sale total $160,000. Under U.S. GAAP, the firm\nreports an inflow of cash from investing activities of $1 million and an outflow of cash\nfrom operating activities of $160,000. Under IFRS, the firm can report a net inflow of\n$840,000 from investing activities.\n"}
