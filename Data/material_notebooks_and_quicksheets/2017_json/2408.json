{"id": "2408", "text": "So far, we have not concerned ourselves with deviations from strategic asset allocations\nor with selection of individual securities within individual asset classes. These activities\nare referred to as active (versus passive) portfolio management strategies. A manager\nwho varies from strategic asset allocation weights in order to take advantage of perceived\nshort-term opportunities is adding tactical asset allocation to the portfolio strategy.\nSecurity selection refers to deviations from index weights on individual securities within\nan asset class. For example, a portfolio manager might overweight energy stocks and\nunderweight financial stocks, relative to the index weights for U.S. large-cap equities\nas an asset class. For some asset classes, such as hedge funds, individual real estate\nproperties, and artwork, investable indexes are not available. For these asset classes,\nselection of individual assets is required by the nature of the asset class.\n"}
