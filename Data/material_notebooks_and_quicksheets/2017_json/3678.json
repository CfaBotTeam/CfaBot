Newly issued\nbonds can be registered with securities regulators for sale to the public, a public offering,\nor sold only to qualified investors, a private placement.\nA public offering of bonds in the primary market is typically done with the help of an\ninvestment bank. The investment bank has expertise in the various steps of a public\noffering, including:\n\u2022 Determining funding needs.\nStructuring the debt security.\nCreating the bond indenture.\nNaming a bond trustee (a trust company or bank trust department).\n\u2022 Registering the issue with securities regulators.\nAssessing demand and pricing the bonds given market conditions.\nSelling the bonds.\nBonds can be sold through an underwritten offering or a best efforts offering. In\nan underwritten offering, the entire bond issue is purchased from the issuing firm by\nthe investment bank, termed the underwriter in this case. While smaller bond issues\nmay be sold by a single investment bank, for larger issues, the lead underwriter heads\na syndicate of investment banks who collectively establish the pricing of the issue and\nare responsible for selling the bonds to dealers, who in turn sell them to investors. The\nsyndicate takes the risk that the bonds will not all be sold.\n"}
