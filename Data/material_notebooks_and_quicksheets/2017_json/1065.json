{"id": 1065, "text": "2. Reserve requirements: By increasing the reserve requirement (the percentage of\ndeposits banks are required to retain as reserves), the central bank effectively\ndecreases the funds that are available for lending and the money supply, which will\ntend to increase interest rates. A decrease in the reserve requirement will increase\nthe funds available for lending and the money supply, which will tend to decrease\ninterest rates. This tool only works well to increase the money supply if banks are\nwilling to lend and customers are willing to borrow.\n"}
