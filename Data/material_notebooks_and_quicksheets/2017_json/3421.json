{"id": 3421, "text": "Professor's Note: One way to remember the effects of changes in the risk-free\nrate is to think about present values of the payments for calls and puts. These\nstatements are strictly true only for in-the-money options, but it's a way to\nremember the relationships. The holder of a call option will pay in the future to\nexercise a call option and the present value of that payment is lower when the\nrisk-free rate is higher, so a higher risk-free rate increases a call option's value.\nThe holder of a put option will receive a payment in the future when the put is\nexercised and an increase in the risk-free rate decreases the present value of this\npayment, so a higher risk-free rate decreases a put option's value.\n"}
