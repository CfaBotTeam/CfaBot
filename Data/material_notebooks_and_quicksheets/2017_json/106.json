{"id": 106, "text": "A histogram is the graphical presentation of the absolute frequency distribution.\nA histogram is simply a bar chart of continuous data that has been classified into a\nfrequency distribution. The attractive feature of a histogram is that it allows us to\nquickly see where most of the observations are concentrated.\nTo construct a histogram, the intervals are scaled on the horizontal axis and the absolute\nfrequencies are scaled on the vertical axis. The histogram for the Intelco returns data in\nTable B from the previous example is provided in Figure 3.\n"}
