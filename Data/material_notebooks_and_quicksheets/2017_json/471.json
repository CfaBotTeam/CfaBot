{"id": "471", "text": "Confidence intervals can be interpreted from a probabilistic perspective or a practical\nperspective. With regard to the outcome of the CFA\u00ae practice exam example, these two\nperspectives can be described as follows:\nProbabilistic interpretation. After repeatedly taking samples of CFA candidates,\nadministering the practice exam, and constructing confidence intervals for each\nsample's mean, 99% of the resulting confidence intervals will, in the long run,\ninclude the population mean.\nPractical interpretation. We are 99% confident that the population mean score is\nbetween 73.55 and 86.45 for candidates from this population.\n"}
