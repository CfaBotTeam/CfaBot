{"id": "3408", "text": "contract rates are all equal in the FRAs that are equivalent to the swap, these would\nnot be zero value forward contracts at the initiation of the swap. Recall that forward\ncontracts are based on a contract rate for which the value of the forward contract at\ninitiation is zero. There is no reason to suspect that the swap fixed rate results in a zero\nvalue forward contract for each of the future dates.\n"}
