{"id": "205", "text": "D. The kurtosis of a normal distribution is 3, so only portfolio C has positive excess\nkurtosis, indicating fatter tails (and more peakedness) relative to a normal distribution.\nE. Negative skew indicates that returns below the mean are more extreme, so we would\nconsider Portfolio C to be the most risky based on skew alone.\nF. Larger kurtosis indicates greater likelihood of extreme outcomes and from a riskmanagement standpoint this indicates greater risk. Portfolio C has the greatest kurtosis.\nThe mean is most affected by large outliers in a distribution, compared to the median\nand mode, which may be unaffected.\nSince the goal is to match the index returns, we must focus on the differences between\nthe returns on the manager's portfolio and those on the index he is attempting to mimic.\nThese differences are referred to as \u201ctracking error.\u201d The standard deviation or variance\nof the differences between his portfolio returns and the returns of the index over a\nnumber of periods would be a suitable measure of his performance. If you said mean\nabsolute deviation, that is defensible as well as it is certainly one way to measure tracking\nerror. It is, however, not the measure of tracking error we see used in practice.\n"}
