{"id": "3629", "text": "Contingent Convertible Bonds\nContingent convertible bonds (referred to as \u201cCoCos\u201d) are bonds that convert from debt\nto common equity automatically if a specific event occurs. This type of bond has been\nissued by some European banks. Banks must maintain specific levels of equity financing.\nIf a bank's equity falls below the required level, they must somehow raise more equity\nfinancing to comply with regulations. CoCos are often structured so that if the bank's\nequity capital falls below a given level, they are automatically converted to common\nstock. This has the effect of decreasing the bank's debt liabilities and increasing its equity\ncapital at the same time, which helps the bank to meet its minimum equity requirement.\n"}
