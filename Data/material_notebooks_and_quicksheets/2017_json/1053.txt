{"id": 1053, "text": "Some developed countries, and several developing countries, choose a target level for\nthe exchange rate of their currency with that of another country, primarily the U.S.\ndollar. This is referred to as pegging their exchange rate with the dollar. If their currency\nappreciates (i.e., becomes relatively more valuable), they can sell their domestic currency\nreserves for dollars to reduce the exchange rate. While such actions may be effective in\nthe short run, for stability of the exchange rate over time, the monetary authorities in\nthe pegging country must manage interest rates and economic activity to achieve their\ngoal. This can lead to increased volatility of their money supply and interest rates. The\npegging country essentially commits to a policy intended to make its inflation rate equal\nto the inflation rate of the country to which they peg their currency.\n"}
