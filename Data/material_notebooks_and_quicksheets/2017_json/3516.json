{"id": 3516, "text": "HEDGE FUNDS\nHedge funds employ a large number of different strategies. Hedge fund managers\nhave more flexibility than managers of traditional investments. Hedge funds can use\nleverage, take short equity positions, and take long or short positions in derivatives.\nThe complex nature of hedge fund transactions leads managers to trade through prime\nbrokers, who provide many services including custodial services, administrative services,\nmoney lending, securities lending for short sales, and trading. Hedge fund managers\ncan negotiate various service parameters with the prime brokers, such as margin\nrequirements.\nHedge fund return objectives can be stated on an absolute basis (e.g., 10%) or on\na relative basis (e.g., returns 5% above a specific benchmark return) depending on\nthe fund strategy. Hedge funds are less regulated than traditional investments. Like\nprivate equity funds, hedge funds are typically set up as limited partnerships, with\nthe investors as the limited (liability) partners. A hedge fund limited partnership may\nnot include more than a proscribed number of investors, who must possess adequate\nwealth, sufficient liquidity, and an acceptable degree of investment sophistication. The\nmanagement firm is the general partner and typically receives both a management fee\nbased on the value of assets managed and an incentive fee based on fund returns.\n"}
