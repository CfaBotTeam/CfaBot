{"id": "3161", "text": "In Figure 1 we illustrate this method. The calculation of approximate modified duration\nis based on a given change in YTM. V is the price of the bond if YTM is decreased by\nAYTM and V, is the price of the bond if the YTM is increased by AYTM. Note that V_\n> V. Because of the convexity of the price-yield relationship, the price increase (to V),\nfor a given decrease in yield, is larger than the price decrease (to V).\n"}
