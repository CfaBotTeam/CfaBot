{"id": "1057", "text": "Much more important are the costs imposed on an economy by unanticipated inflation,\ninflation that is higher or lower than the expected rate of inflation. When inflation is\nhigher than expected, borrowers gain at the expense of lenders as loan payments in the\nfuture are made with currency that has less value in real terms. Conversely, inflation that\nis less than expected will benefit lenders at the expense of borrowers. In an economy\nwith volatile (rather than certain) inflation rates, lenders will require higher interest rates\nto compensate for the additional risk they face from unexpected changes in inflation.\nHigher borrowing rates slow business investment and reduce the level of economic\nactivity.\n"}
