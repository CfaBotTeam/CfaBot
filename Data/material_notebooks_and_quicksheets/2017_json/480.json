{"id": "480", "text": "As it turns out, the size of the sample influences whether or not we can construct the\nappropriate confidence interval for the sample mean.\nIf the distribution is nonnormal but the population variance is known, the z-statistic\ncan be used as long as the sample size is large (n > 30). We can do this because\nthe central limit theorem assures us that the distribution of the sample mean is\napproximately normal when the sample is large.\nIf the distribution is nonnormal and the population variance is unknown, the t-statistic\ncan be used as long as the sample size is large (n > 30). It is also acceptable to use\nthe z-statistic, although use of the t-statistic is more conservative.\nThis means that if we are sampling from a nonnormal distribution (which is sometimes\nthe case in finance), we cannot create a confidence interval if the sample size is less than 30.\nSo, all else equal, make sure you have a sample of at least 30, and the larger, the better.\n"}
