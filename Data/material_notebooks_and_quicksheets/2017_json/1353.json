{"id": 1353, "text": "Recall that price takers should produce where P = MC. Referring to Panel (a) in Figure\n7, a firm will shut down at a price below P. Between P, and P, a firm will continue\nto operate in the short run. At P, the firm is earning a normal profit\u2014economic profit\nequals zero. At prices above P, a firm is making economic profits and will expand its\nproduction along the MC line. Thus, the short-run supply curve for a firm is its MC\nline above the average variable cost curve, AVC. The supply curve shown in Panel (b) is\nthe short-run market supply curve, which is the horizontal sum (add up the quantities\nfrom all firms at each price) of the MC curves for all firms in a given industry. Because\nfirms will supply more units at higher prices, the short-run market supply curve slopes\nupward to the right.\n"}
