{"id": 442, "text": "A Sampling Distribution\nIt is important to recognize that the sample statistic itself is a random variable and,\ntherefore, has a probability distribution. The sampling distribution of the sample\nstatistic is a probability distribution of all possible sample statistics computed from a set\nof equal-size samples that were randomly drawn from the same population. Think of it\nas the probability distribution of a statistic from many samples.\nFor example, suppose a random sample of 100 bonds is selected from a population of\na major municipal bond index consisting of 1,000 bonds, and then the mean return\nof the 100-bond sample is calculated. Repeating this process many times will result in\nmany different estimates of the population mean return (i.e., one for each sample). The\ndistribution of these estimates of the mean is the sampling distribution of the mean.\n"}
