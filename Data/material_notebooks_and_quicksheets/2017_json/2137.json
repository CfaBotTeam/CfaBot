The alternative to taking\na portfolio perspective is to examine the risk and return of individual investments in\nisolation. An investor who holds all his wealth in a single stock because he believes it to\nbe the best stock available is not taking the portfolio perspective\u2014his portfolio is very\nrisky compared to holding a diversified portfolio of stocks. Modern portfolio theory\nconcludes that the extra risk from holding only a single security is not rewarded with\nhigher expected investment returns. Conversely, diversification allows an investor to\nreduce portfolio risk without necessarily reducing the portfolio's expected return.\n"}
