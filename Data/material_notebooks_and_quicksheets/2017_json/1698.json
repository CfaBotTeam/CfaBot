A stable\nrelationship of operating cash flow and net income is an indication of quality earnings.\n(This relationship can also be affected by the business cycle and the firm's life cycle.)\nEarnings that significantly exceed operating cash flow may be an indication of aggressive\n(or even improper) accounting choices such as recognizing revenues too soon or delaying\nthe recognition of expenses. The variability of net income and operating cash flow\nshould also be considered.\n"}
