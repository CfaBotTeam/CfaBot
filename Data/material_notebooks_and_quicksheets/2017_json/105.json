{"id": "105", "text": "The cumulative absolute frequency or cumulative relative frequency for any given\ninterval is the sum of the absolute or relative frequencies up to and including the given\ninterval. For example, the cumulative absolute frequency for R < 10% is 13 = 1 + 2 + 3\n+ 7 and the cumulative relative frequency over this range is 5% + 10% + 15% + 35% =\n65%.\n"}
