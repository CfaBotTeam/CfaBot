{"id": 3117, "text": "A planned amortization class (PAC) CMO has PAC tranches that receive predictable\ncash flows as long as the prepayment rate remains within a predetermined range, and\nsupport tranches that have more contraction risk and more extension risk than the PAC\ntranches.\nLOS 54.f\nPrepayment risk refers to uncertainty about the timing of the principal cash flows from\nan ABS. Contraction risk is the risk that loan principal will be repaid more rapidly than\nexpected, typically when interest rates have decreased. Extension risk is the risk that loan\nprincipal will be repaid more slowly than expected, typically when interest rates have\nincreased.\n"}
