{"id": "2138", "text": "In the early 1950s, the research of Professor Harry Markowitz provided a framework for\nmeasuring the risk-reduction benefits of diversification. Using the standard deviation of\nreturns as the measure of investment risk, he investigated how combining risky securities\ninto a portfolio affected the portfolio's risk and expected return. One important\nconclusion of his model is that unless the returns of the risky assets are perfectly\npositively correlated, risk is reduced by diversifying across assets.\nIn the 1960s, professors Treynor, Sharpe, Mossin, and Lintner independently extended\nthis work into what has become known as modern portfolio theory (MPT). MPT\nresults in equilibrium expected returns for securities and portfolios that are a linear\nfunction of each security's or portfolio's market risk (the risk that cannot be reduced by\ndiversification).\n"}
