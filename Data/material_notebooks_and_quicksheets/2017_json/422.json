{"id": 422, "text": "CHALLENGE PROBLEMS\n1. A stock's price is $8.50 today. You decide to model the stock price over time\nusing a binomial model (as a Bernoulli random variable) with a probability of an\nup-move of 60%. The up-move factor is 1.05.\nA. How many different prices are possible for the stock at the end of two\nperiods?\nB. What are the possible prices after two periods?\nC. What is the probability that the stock price will be $8.50 after three periods?\nD. What is the probability that the stock price will be $8.925 after three\nperiods?\nE. What is the probability that the stock price will be unchanged after six\nperiods?\nAn analyst has developed a model of option prices as a function of a short-term\ninterest rate and the price of the underlying stock. She decides to test the model\nwith a Monte Carlo simulation.\nA. What steps does she need to perform to run the simulation?\nB. What limitations of Monte Carlo simulation does she need to keep in mind\nwhen she interprets the results?\nC. What would be the advantages of using historical simulation instead of\nMonte Carlo simulation? What would be the drawbacks?\nThe monthly returns on an index of investment-grade corporate bonds for the\nlast ten years have averaged 0.7% with a standard deviation of 2.0%.\nA. Assuming the returns are approximately normally distributed, what are the\n90%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals for the monthly return on this\nindex?\n"}
