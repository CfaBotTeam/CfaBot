{"id": "484", "text": "Data-Mining Bias, Sample Selection Bias, Survivorship Bias, Look-Ahead Bias,\nand Time-Period Bias\nData mining occurs when analysts repeatedly use the same database to search for\npatterns or trading rules until one that \u201cworks\u201d is discovered. For example, empirical\nresearch has provided evidence that value stocks appear to outperform growth stocks.\nSome researchers argue that this anomaly is actually the product of data mining. Because\nthe data set of historical stock returns is quite limited, it is difficult to know for sure\nwhether the difference between value and growth stock returns is a true economic\nphenomenon, or simply a chance pattern that was stumbled upon after repeatedly\nlooking for any identifiable pattern in the data.\nData-mining bias refers to results where the statistical significance of the pattern is\noverestimated because the results were found through data mining.\nWhen reading research findings that suggest a profitable trading strategy, make sure you\nheed the following warning signs of data mining:\nEvidence that many different variables were tested, most of which are unreported,\nuntil significant ones were found.\nThe lack of any economic theory that is consistent with the empirical results.\nThe best way to avoid data mining is to test a potentially profitable trading rule on a\ndata set different from the one you used to develop the rule (i.e., use out-of-sample\ndata).\n"}
