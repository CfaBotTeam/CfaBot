For analytical purposes, an analyst is usually\nmore interested in the type of asset acquired rather than the value assigned on the\nbalance sheet. For example, recently acquired franchise rights may provide insight into\nthe firm's future operating performance. In this case, the allocation of cost is not as\nimportant.\n"}
