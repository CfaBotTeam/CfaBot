{"id": 206, "text": "7. A. With 20 datapoints, the top quartile (4) is the top 5. Count down from the greatest\nvalue to find the 5th from the top is 21%.\nB. The location of the 40th percentile is (20 + 1) (40/100) = 8.4. The 8th and 9th lowest\nreturns are 6% and 7%, so the 40th percentile is 6 + 0.4(7 - 6) = 6.4%.\nC. The range of the data is 32 - (-28) = 60.\nD. Divide the range by 12 to get 5. The 10th interval from the bottom is the 3rd from the\ntop. The top three intervals are 27 < x < 32, 22 <x< 27, and 17 < x < 22. There are\nonly two observations in the 10th interval, 18% and 21%. The relative frequency is 2/20\n= 10%. Since there are four observations > 22%, the cumulative relative frequency of\nthe 10th interval is (20 \u2013 4)/20 = 80%.\n"}
