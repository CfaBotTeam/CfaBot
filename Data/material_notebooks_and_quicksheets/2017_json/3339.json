{"id": 3339, "text": "The settlement price is analogous to the closing price for a stock but is not simply\nthe price of the final trade of the day. It is an average of the prices of the trades during\nthe last period of trading, called the closing period, which is set by the exchange. This\nspecification of the settlement price reduces the opportunity of traders to manipulate\nthe settlement price. The settlement price is used to calculate the daily gain or loss at the\nend of each trading day. On its final day of trading the settlement price is equal to the\nspot price of the underlying asset (i.e., futures prices converge to spot prices as futures\ncontracts approach expiration).\n"}
