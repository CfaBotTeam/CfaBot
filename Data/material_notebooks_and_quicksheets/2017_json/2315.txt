Given this scenario, the stock with more total risk (the\nbiotech stock) has less systematic risk and will therefore have a lower equilibrium rate of\nreturn according to capital market theory.\nNote that holding many biotech firms in a portfolio will diversify away the firm-specific\nrisk. Some will have blockbuster products and some will fail, but you can imagine that\nwhen 50 or 100 such stocks are combined into a portfolio, the uncertainty about the\nportfolio return is much less than the uncertainty about the return of a single biotech\nfirm stock.\n"}
