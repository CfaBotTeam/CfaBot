{"id": 379, "text": "Calculating Probabilities Using z-Values\nNow we will show how to use standardized values (z-values) and a table of probabilities\nfor Z to determine probabilities. A portion of a table of the cumulative distribution\nfunction for a standard normal distribution is shown in Figure 7. We will refer to this\ntable as the z-table, as it contains values generated using the cumulative density function\nfor a standard normal distribution, denoted by F(Z). Thus, the values in the z-table are\nthe probabilities of observing a z-value that is less than a given value, z [i.e., P(Z < 2)).\nThe numbers in the first column are z-values that have only one decimal place. The\ncolumns to the right supply probabilities for z-values with two decimal places.\n"}
