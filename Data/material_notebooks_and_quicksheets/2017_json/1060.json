{"id": "1060", "text": "Income Elasticity of Demand\nRecall that one of the independent variables in our example of a demand function for\ngasoline was income. The sensitivity of quantity demanded to a change in income is\ntermed income elasticity. Holding other independent variables constant, we can measure\nincome elasticity as the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded to the\npercentage change in income.\nFor most goods, the sign of income elasticity is positive\u2014an increase in income leads to\nan increase in quantity demanded. Goods for which this is the case are termed normal\ngoods. For other goods, it may be the case that an increase in income leads to a decrease\nin quantity demanded. Goods for which this is true are termed inferior goods.\n"}
