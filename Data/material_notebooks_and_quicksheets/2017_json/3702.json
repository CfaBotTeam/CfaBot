{"id": "3702", "text": "Corporations issue debt securities called medium-term notes (MTNs), which are not\nnecessarily medium-term in maturity. MTNs are issued in various maturities, ranging\nfrom nine months to periods as long as 100 years. Issuers provide maturity ranges (e.g.,\n18 months to two years) for MTNs they wish to sell and provide yield quotes for\nthose ranges. Investors interested in purchasing the notes make an offer to the issuer\u2019s\nagent, specifying the face value and an exact maturity within one of the ranges offered.\nThe agent then confirms the issuer's willingness to sell those MTNs and effects the\ntransaction.\n"}
