{"id": 2046, "text": "An asset is impaired when its carrying value (original cost less accumulated depreciation)\nexceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of its fair value\nless any selling costs and its value in use. The value in use is the present value of its\nfuture cash flow stream from continued use.\nIf impaired, the asset's value must be written down on the balance sheet to the\nrecoverable amount. An impairment loss, equal to the excess of carrying value over the\nrecoverable amount, is recognized in the income statement.\n"}
