{"id": 2110, "text": "Accounts Payable Management\nJust as a company must manage its receivables because they require working capital (and\ntherefore have a funding cost), payables must be managed well because they represent\na source of working capital to the firm. If the firm pays its payables prior to their due\ndates, cash is used unnecessarily and interest on it is sacrificed. If a firm pays its payables\nlate, it can damage relationships with suppliers and lead to more restrictive credit terms\nor even the requirement that purchases be made for cash. Late payment can also result in\ninterest charges that are high compared to other sources of short-term financing.\nTypical terms on payables (trade credit) contain a discount available to those who pay\nquickly as well as a due date. Terms of \u201c2/10 net 60\u201d mean that if the invoice is paid\nwithin ten days, the company gets a 2% discount on the invoiced amount and that if the\ncompany does not take advantage of the discount, the net amount is due 60 days from\nthe date of the invoice.\n"}
