{"id": 3514, "text": "Historical returns for alternative investments have been higher on average than for\ntraditional investments, so adding alternative investments to a traditional portfolio may\nincrease expected returns. The reasons for these higher returns are thought to be that\nsome alternative investments are less efficiently priced than traditional assets (providing\nopportunities for skilled managers), that alternative investments may offer extra returns\nfor being iliquid, and that alternative investments often use leverage.\nWhile it seems that adding alternative investments to a portfolio will improve both\nportfolio risk and expected return, choosing the optimal portfolio allocation to\nalternative investments is complex and there are potential problems with historical\nreturns data and traditional risk measures. Survivorship bias refers to the upward bias of\nreturns if data only for currently existing (surviving) firms is included. Since surviving\nfirms tend to be those that had better-than-average returns, excluding the returns data\nfor failed firms results in average returns that are biased upward. Backfill bias refers to\nbias introduced by including the previous performance data for firms recently added to a\nbenchmark index. Since firms that are newly added to an index must be those that have\nsurvived and done better than average, including their returns for prior years (without\nincluding the previous and current returns for funds that have not been added to the\nindex) tends to bias index returns upward.\n"}
