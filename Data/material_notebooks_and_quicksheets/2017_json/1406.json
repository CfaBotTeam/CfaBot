{"id": 1406, "text": "In markets characterized as monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly, there\nis no well-defined supply function. This is because under all three of these market\nstructures, firms face downward-sloping demand curves. In each case, the quantity\nsupplied is determined by the intersection of marginal cost and marginal revenue, and\nthe price charged is then determined by the demand curve the firm faces. We cannot\nconstruct a function of quantity supplied as a function of price as we can under perfect\ncompetition, where price equals marginal revenue. The quantity supplied depends not\nonly on a firm's marginal cost, but on demand and marginal revenue (which change with\nquantity) as well.\n"}
