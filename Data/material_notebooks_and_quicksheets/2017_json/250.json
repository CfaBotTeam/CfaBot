{"id": "250", "text": "You might well wonder where the returns and probabilities used in calculating expected\nvalues come from. A general framework called a tree diagram is used to show the\nprobabilities of various outcomes. In Figure 3, we have shown estimates of EPS for four\ndifferent outcomes: (1) a good economy and relatively good results at the company, (2)\na good economy and relatively poor results at the company, (3) a poor economy and\nrelatively good results at the company, and (4) a poor economy and relatively poor results\nat the company. Using the rules of probability, we can calculate the probabilities of each\nof the four EPS outcomes shown in the boxes on the right-hand side of the \u201ctree.\"\nFigure 3: A Tree Diagram\n"}
