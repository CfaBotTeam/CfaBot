{"id": "99", "text": "The following procedure describes how to construct a frequency distribution.\nStep 1: Define the intervals. The first step in building a frequency distribution is to\ndefine the intervals to which data measurements (observations) will be assigned.\nAn interval, also referred to as a class, is the set of values that an observation may\ntake on. The range of values for each interval must have a lower and upper limit\nand be all-inclusive and nonoverlapping. Intervals must be mutually exclusive in\na way that each observation can be placed in only one interval, and the total set\nof intervals should cover the total range of values for the entire population.\nThe number of intervals used is an important consideration. If too few intervals\nare used, the data may be too broadly summarized, and important characteristics\nmay be lost. On the other hand, if too many intervals are used, the data may not\nbe summarized enough.\nStep 2: Tally the observations. After the intervals have been defined, the observations\nmust be tallied, or assigned to their appropriate interval.\nStep 3: Count the observations. Having tallied the data set, the number of observations\nthat are assigned to each interval must be counted. The absolute frequency, or\nsimply the frequency, is the actual number of observations that fall within a\ngiven interval.\n"}
