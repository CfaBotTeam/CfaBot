{"id": 3377, "text": "When the equality holds we say the derivative is currently at its no-arbitrage price.\nBecause we know Rf, the spot price of the asset, and the certain payoff at time T, we\ncan solve for the no-arbitrage price of the derivative based on the no arbitrage price of\nthe forward. Note the investor's risk aversion has not entered into our valuation of the\nderivative as it did when we described the valuation of a risky asset. For this reason,\nthe determination of the no-arbitrage derivative price is sometimes called risk-neutral\npricing, which is the same as no-arbitrage pricing or the price under a no-arbitrage\ncondition.\n"}
