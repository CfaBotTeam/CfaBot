{"id": 533, "text": "The test statistic is computed the same way, regardless of whether we are using a onetailed or two-tailed test. From the previous example, we know that the test statistic\nfor the option return sample is 6.33. Since 6.33 > 1.645, we reject the null hypothesis\nand conclude that mean returns are statistically greater than zero at a 5% level of\nsignificance.\n"}
