{"id": 1204, "text": "LOS 19.b\nFree trade among countries increases overall economic welfare. Countries can benefit\nfrom trade because one country can specialize in the production of an export good and\nbenefit from economies of scale. Economic welfare can also be increased by greater\nproduct variety, more competition, and a more efficient allocation of resources.\nCosts of free trade are primarily losses to those in domestic industries that lose business\nto foreign competition, especially less efficient producers who leave an industry. While\nother domestic industries will benefit from freer trade policies, unemployment may\nincrease over the period in which workers are retrained for jobs in the expanding\nindustries. Some argue that greater income inequality may result, but overall the gains\nfrom liberalization of trade policies are thought to exceed the costs, so that the winners\ncould conceivably compensate the losers and still be better off.\n"}
