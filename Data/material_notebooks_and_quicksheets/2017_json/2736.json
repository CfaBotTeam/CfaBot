In some industries,\ncompetition is intense and few firms earn economic profits. Economic profits, the return\non invested capital minus its cost, are greater than 20% in some industries and negative\nin others.

An analyst should understand that industry conditions\nand profits can change dramatically over time, so industry analysis should be forwardlooking.\n"}
