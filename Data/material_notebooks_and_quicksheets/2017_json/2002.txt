{"id": 2002, "text": "Shareholders' Equity\nBecause capitalization results in higher net income in the period of the expenditure\ncompared to expensing, it also results in higher shareholders equity because retained\nearnings are greater. Total assets are greater with capitalization and liabilities are\nunaffected, so the accounting equation (A = L + E) remains balanced. As the cost is\nallocated to the income statement in subsequent periods, net income, retained earnings,\nand shareholders' equity will be reduced.\n"}
