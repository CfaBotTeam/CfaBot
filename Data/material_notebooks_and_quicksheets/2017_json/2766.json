{"id": "2766", "text": "Capacity is fixed in the short run and variable in the long run. Undercapacity typically\nresults in pricing power. Producers may overinvest in new capacity, especially in cyclical\nindustries or if the capacity is physical and specialized. Non-physical capacity comes into\nproduction and can be reallocated more quickly than physical capacity.\nHighly variable market shares indicate a highly competitive industry. Stable market\nshares suggest less intense competition. High switching costs contribute to market share\nstability.\n"}
