{"id": 1929, "text": "Under U.S. GAAP, inventory is reported at the lower of cost or market. In this case,\nmarket is equal to replacement cost of $197, since net realizable value of $203 is\ngreater than replacement cost, and net realizable value minus a normal profit margin\n($203 \u2013 $12 = $191) is less than replacement cost. Since original cost exceeds market\n(replacement cost), the inventory is written down to $197 and a $13 loss ($197\nreplacement cost \u2013 $210 original cost) is reported in the income statement.\n"}
