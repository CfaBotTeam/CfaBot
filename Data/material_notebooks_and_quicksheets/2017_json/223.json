{"id": 223, "text": "Figure 1 illustrates the addition rule with a Venn Diagram and highlights why the joint\nprobability must be subtracted from the sum of the unconditional probabilities. Note\nthat if the events are mutually exclusive the sets do not intersect, P(AB) = 0, and the\nprobability that one of the two events will occur is simply P(A) + P(B).\n"}
