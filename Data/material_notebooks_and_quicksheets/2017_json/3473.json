{"id": 3473, "text": "Yields could increase because an issuer's credit rating has fallen, in which case the higher\nstep-up coupon rate simply compensates investors for greater credit risk. Aside from this,\nwe can view step-up coupon bonds as having some protection against increases in market\ninterest rates to the extent they are offset by increases in bond coupon rates.\nA credit-linked coupon bond carries a provision stating that the coupon rate will go up\nby a certain amount if the credit rating of the issuer falls and go down if the credit rating\nof the issuer improves. While this offers some protection against a credit downgrade of\nthe issuer, the higher required coupon payments may make the financial situation of the\nissuer worse and possibly increase the probability of default.\nA payment-in-kind (PIK) bond allows the issuer to make the coupon payments by\nincreasing the principal amount of the outstanding bonds, essentially paying bond\ninterest with more bonds. Firms that issue PIK bonds typically do so because they\nanticipate that firm cash flows may be less than required to service the debt, often\nbecause of high levels of debt financing (leverage). These bonds typically have higher\nyields because of a lower perceived credit quality from cash flow shortfalls or simply\nbecause of the high leverage of the issuing firm.\nWith a deferred coupon bond, also called a split coupon bond, regular coupon\npayments do not begin until a period of time after issuance. These are issued by firms\nthat anticipate cash flows will increase in the future to allow them to make coupon\ninterest payments.\n"}
