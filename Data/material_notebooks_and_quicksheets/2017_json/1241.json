{"id": 1241, "text": "We call this a no-arbitrage condition because if it doesn't hold there is an opportunity\nto make a profit without risk. The possible arbitrage is as follows: borrow Currency A at\ninterest rate A, convert it to Currency B at the spot rate and invest it to earn interest rate\nB, and sell the proceeds from this investment forward at the forward rate to turn it back\ninto Currency A. If the forward rate does not correctly reflect the difference between\ninterest rates, such an arbitrage could generate a profit to the extent that the return from\ninvesting Currency B and converting it back to Currency A with a forward contract is\ngreater than the cost of borrowing Currency A for the period. We consider a numerical\nanalysis of such an arbitrage later in this topic review.\nFor spot and forward rates expressed as price currency/base currency, the no-arbitrage\nrelation (commonly referred to as interest rate parity) is:\nforward (1+ interest rate price currency)\nspot (1+ interest ratebase currency)\n"}
