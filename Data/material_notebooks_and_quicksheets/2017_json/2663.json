{"id": "2663", "text": "1. B In informationally efficient capital markets, new information is quickly reflected\nin security prices. Investors react only to unexpected information releases because\ninformation releases that are expected will already be reflected in securities prices. Active\nstrategies will underperform in an efficient market because they have greater transactions\nand management costs than passive strategies and will not consistently create positive\nabnormal returns after adjusting for risk.\n2. B Short selling promotes market efficiency because the sales pressure from short selling can\nreduce the prices of assets that have become overvalued.\n3. A Intrinsic value changes as new information arrives in the marketplace. It cannot be\nknown with certainty and can only be estimated. The price of an asset at a given point in\ntime is its market value, which will differ from its intrinsic value if markets are not fully\nefficient.\n4. A Weak-form EMH states that stock prices fully reflect all market (i.e., price and volume)\ninformation.\n\u00b7 B Tests indicate that mutual fund performance has been inferior to that of a passive index\nstrategy.\n6. C The majority of evidence is that anomalies are not violations of market efficiency but are\ndue to the research methodologies used. Portfolio management based on anomalies will\nlikely be unprofitable after transactions costs are considered.\n7. C Loss aversion refers to the tendency of investors to be more risk averse when faced\nwith potential losses and less risk averse when faced with potential gains. That is, they\ndislike losses more than they like gains of an equal amount. Their risk preferences are\nasymmetric.\n"}
