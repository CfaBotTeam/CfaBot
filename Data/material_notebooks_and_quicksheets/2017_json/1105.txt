{"id": 1105, "text": "Ricardian Equivalence\nIncreases in the current deficit mean greater taxes in the future. To maintain their\npreferred pattern of consumption over time, taxpayers may increase current savings\n(reduce current consumption) in order to offset the expected cost of higher future taxes.\nIf taxpayers reduce current consumption and increase current saving by just enough to\nrepay the principal and interest on the debt the government issued to fund the increased\ndeficit, there is no effect on aggregate demand. This is known as Ricardian equivalence\nafter economist David Ricardo. If taxpayers underestimate their future liability for\nservicing and repaying the debt, so that aggregate demand is increased by equal spending\nand tax increases, Ricardian equivalence does not hold. Whether it does is an open\nquestion.\n"}
