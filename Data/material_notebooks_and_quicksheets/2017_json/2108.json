{"id": 2108, "text": "The information necessary to compare a firm's aging schedule and weighted average\ncollection period to other firms is not available. However, analysis of the historical trends\nand significant changes in a firm's aging schedule and weighted average collection days\ncan give a clearer picture of what is driving changes in the simpler metric of average days\nof receivables. The company must always evaluate the trade-off between stricter credit\nterms (and borrower creditworthiness) and the ability to make sales. Terms that are too\nstrict will lead to less-than-optimal sales. Terms that are too lenient will increase sales at\nthe cost of longer average days of receivables, which must be funded at some cost, and\nwill increase bad accounts, directly affecting profitability.\n"}
