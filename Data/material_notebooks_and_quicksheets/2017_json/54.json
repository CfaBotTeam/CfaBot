{"id": "54", "text": "Professor's Note: In the preceding example, we entered the flows into the account\nas positive and the ending value as a negative (the investor could withdraw this\namount from the account). Note that there is no difference in the solution if\nwe enter the cash flows into the account as negative values (out of the investor's\npocket) and the ending value as a positive value (into the investor's pocket). As\nlong as payments into the account and payments out of the account (including the\nending value) are entered with opposite signs, the computed IRR will be correct.\n"}
