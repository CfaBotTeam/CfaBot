{"id": 401, "text": "Historical simulation is based on actual changes in value or actual changes in risk\nfactors over some prior period. Rather than model the distribution of risk factors, as\nin Monte Carlo simulation, the set of all changes in the relevant risk factors over some\nprior period is used. Each iteration of the simulation involves randomly selecting one of\nthese past changes for each risk factor and calculating the value of the asset or portfolio\nin question, based on those changes in risk factors.\nHistorical simulation has the advantage of using the actual distribution of risk factors\nso that the distribution of changes in the risk factors does not have to be estimated.\nIt suffers from the fact that past changes in risk factors may not be a good indication\nof future changes. Events that occur infrequently may not be reflected in historical\nsimulation results unless the events occurred during the period from which the values for\nrisk factors are drawn. An additional limitation of historical simulation is that it cannot\naddress the sort of \u201cwhat if\u201d questions that Monte Carlo simulation can. With Monte\nCarlo simulation, we can investigate the effect on the distribution of security/portfolio\nvalues if we increase the variance of one of the risk factors by 20%; with historical\nsimulation we cannot do this.\n"}
