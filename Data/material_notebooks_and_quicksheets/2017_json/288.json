{"id": "288", "text": "If there are n labels (k = n), we have != n!. The number of ways to assign n different\nlabels to n items is simply n!.\nA special case of labeling arises when the number of labels equals 2 (k = 2). That is, the\nn items can only be in one of two groups, and n, + n) = n. In this case, we can let r = n,\nand n, = n-r. Since there are only two categories, we usually talk about choosing r\nitems. Then (n-r) items are not chosen. The general formula for labeling when k = 2 is\ncalled the combination formula (or binomial formula) and is expressed as:\n"}
