{"id": 3855, "text": "A residential mortgage loan is a loan for which the collateral that underlies the loan is\nresidential real estate. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender has a legal claim\nto the collateral property. One key characteristic of a mortgage loan is its loan-to-value\nratio (LTV), the percentage of the value of the collateral real estate that is loaned to the\nborrower. The lower the LTV, the higher the borrower's equity in the property.\n"}
