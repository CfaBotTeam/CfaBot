{"id": "1537", "text": "12. A Since the y-axis of the aggregate supply/demand model is the price level, a change in\nthe price level is a movement along the AD curve. As long as inflation expectations are\nunchanged, an increase in the price level will not shift the aggregate demand curve.\n13. A If AD is increasing faster than LRAS, the economy is expanding faster than its fullemployment rate of output. This will cause pressure on wages and resource prices and\nlead to an increase in the price level. The SRAS curve will shift to the left-a decrease\nin supply for any given price level\u2013until the rate of output growth slows to its fullemployment potential.\n14. A Increased investment in physical capital can increase labor productivity. Labor force\nparticipation rates and net immigration affect the size of the labor force and the\naggregate number of hours worked, but do not necessarily affect labor productivity.\n15. B The sustainable rate of economic growth is a measurement of the rate of increase in\nthe economy's productive capacity. An economy's sustainable rate of growth depends\non the growth rate of the labor supply and the growth rate of labor productivity. Due\nto diminishing marginal productivity, an economy generally cannot achieve long-term\nsustainable growth through continually increasing the stock of capital relative to labor\n(i.e., capital deepening).\n16. C For developed economies, advances in technology are likely to be the primary source\nof growth in potential GDP because capital per worker is already high enough to\nexperience diminishing marginal productivity of capital.\n"}
