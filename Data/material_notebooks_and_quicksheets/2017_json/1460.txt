{"id": 1460, "text": "Investment is a function of expected profitability and the cost of financing. Expected\nprofitability depends on the overall level of economic output. Financing costs are\nreflected in real interest rates, which are approximated by nominal interest rates\nminus the expected inflation rate.\nGovernment purchases may be viewed as independent of economic activity to a\ndegree, but tax revenue to the government, and therefore the fiscal balance, is clearly\na function of economic output.\nNet exports are a function of domestic disposable incomes (which affect imports),\nforeign disposable incomes (which affect exports), and relative prices of goods in\nforeign and domestic markets.\nThe IS curve (income-savings) in Figure 2 illustrates the negative relationship between\nreal interest rates and real income for equilibrium in the goods market. Points on the IS\ncurve are the combinations of real interest rates and income consistent with equilibrium\nin the goods market (i.e., those combinations of real interest rates and income for which\nplanned expenditures equal income).\n"}
