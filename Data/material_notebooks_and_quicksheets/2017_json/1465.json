{"id": 1465, "text": "The Aggregate Demand Curve\nWhen the IS and LM curves are combined, the point at which they intersect represents\nthe levels of the real interest rate and income that are consistent with equilibrium\nbetween income and expenditure (points along the IS curve) and equilibrium between\nthe real money supply and the real interest rate (points along the LM curve). The\nintersection between the IS and LM curves determines the equilibrium levels of prices\nand real income (real GDP) for a given level of the real money supply.\nThe aggregate demand curve shows the relationship between the quantity of real output\ndemanded (which equals real income) and the price level. When we drew the LM curve,\nwe held the real money supply (M/P) constant. Now, if we hold the nominal money\nsupply (M) constant, changes in the real money supply are due to changes in the price\nlevel (P). An increase in the price level will decrease the real money supply (M/P), and a\ndecrease in the price level will increase the real money supply (M/P).\n"}
