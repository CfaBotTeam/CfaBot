A\ndownward-sloping segment of an LRATC curve indicates economies of scale (increasing\nreturns to scale). Over such a segment, increasing the scale of the firm reduces ATC.\nAn upward-sloping segment of an LRATC curve indicates diseconomies of scale, where\naverage unit costs will rise as the scale of the business (and long-run output) increases.\n"}
