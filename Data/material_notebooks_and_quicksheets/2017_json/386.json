{"id": "386", "text": "Panel B of Figure 8 relates the SFRatio to the standard normal distribution. Note that\nthe SFR is the number of standard deviations below the mean. Thus, the portfolio with\nthe larger SFR has the lower probability of returns below the threshold return, which\nis a return of 0% in our example. Using a z-table for negative values, we can find the\nprobabilities in the left-hand tails as indicated. These probabilities (25% for Portfolio A\nand 20% for Portfolio B) are also the shortfall risk for a target return of 0%, that is, the\nprobability of negative returns. Portfolio B has the higher SFR which means it has the\nlower probability of negative returns.\n"}
