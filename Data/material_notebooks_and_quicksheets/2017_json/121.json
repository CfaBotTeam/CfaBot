{"id": 121, "text": "When calculating the geometric mean for a returns data set, it is necessary to add 1 to\neach value under the radical and then subtract 1 from the result. The geometric mean\nreturn (RG) can be computed using the following equation:\n1+RG = /(1+R)x(1+R2)X...X(1+R)\nwhere:\nR = the return for period t\nExample: Geometric mean return\nFor the last three years, the returns for Acme Corporation common stock have been\n-9.34%, 23.45%, and 8.92%. Compute the compound annual rate of return over the\n3-year period.\n"}
