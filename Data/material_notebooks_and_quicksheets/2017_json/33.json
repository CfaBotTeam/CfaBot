{"id": "33", "text": "On the TI BAII Plus calculator, the sequence of [I][] scrolls past the variables F01,\nF02, et cetera. The F here stands for frequency, and this is set to 1 by default. We did\nnot enter anything because each cash flow amount occurred only once. If the period 2\ncash flow, CO2, were repeated three times (at t = 2, 3, and 4) we could input F02 = 3 to\naccount for all three of these. The next input, C03, would then refer to the cash flow at\nt = 5.\n"}
