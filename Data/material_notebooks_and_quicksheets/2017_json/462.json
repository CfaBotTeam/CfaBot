{"id": "462", "text": "Student\u2019s t-distribution has the following properties:\n\u2022 It is symmetrical.\nIt is defined by a single parameter, the degrees of freedom (df), where the degrees of\nfreedom are equal to the number of sample observations minus 1, n-1, for sample\nmeans.\nIt has more probability in the tails (\u201cfatter tails\u201d) than the normal distribution.\nAs the degrees of freedom (the sample size) gets larger, the shape of the t-distribution\nmore closely approaches a standard normal distribution.\nWhen compared to the normal distribution, the t-distribution is latter with more area\nunder the tails (i.e., it has fatter tails). As the degrees of freedom for the t-distribution\nincrease, however, its shape approaches that of the normal distribution.\nThe degrees of freedom for tests based on sample means are n - 1 because, given the\nmean, only n-1 observations can be unique.\n"}
