{"id": "3432", "text": "Put-call-forward parity is derived with a forward contract rather than the underlying\nasset itself. Consider a forward contract on an asset at time T with a contract price of\nF(T). At contract initiation the forward contract has zero value. At time T, when the\nforward contract settles, the long must purchase the asset for F,(T). The purchase (at\ntime=0) of a pure discount bond that will pay F,(T) at maturity (time = T) will cost\nF(T) / (1 + Rf)T\n"}
