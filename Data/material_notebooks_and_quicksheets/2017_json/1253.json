{"id": 1253, "text": "A specific good may be an inferior good for some ranges of income and a normal good\nfor other ranges of income. For a really poor person or population (e.g., underdeveloped\ncountry), an increase in income may lead to greater consumption of noodles or rice.\nNow, if incomes rise a bit (e.g., college student or developing country), more meat\nor seafood may become part of the diet. Over this range of incomes, noodles can be\nan inferior good and ground meat a normal good. If incomes rise to a higher range\n(e.g., graduated from college and got a job), the consumption of ground meat may fall\n(inferior) in favor of preferred cuts of meat (normal).\n"}
