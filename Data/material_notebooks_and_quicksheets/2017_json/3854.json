{"id": "3854", "text": "Tranche B is first to absorb any losses (and is termed the first-loss tranche) until they\nexceed $30 million in principal. Any losses from default of the underlying assets greater\nthan $30 million, and up to $110 million, will be absorbed by Subordinated Tranche\nA. The Senior Tranche is protected from any credit losses of $110 million or less and\ntherefore will have the highest credit rating and offer the lowest yield of the three bond\nclasses. This structure is also called a waterfall structure because in liquidation, each\nsubordinated tranche would receive only the \"overflow\u201d from the more senior tranche(s)\nif they are repaid their principal value in full.\nWith time tranching, the first (sequential) tranche receives all principal repayments\nfrom the underlying assets up to the principal value of the tranche. The second tranche\nwould then receive all principal repayments from the underlying assets until the\nprincipal value of this tranche is paid off. There may be other tranches with sequential\nclaims to remaining principal repayments. Both credit tranching and time tranching are\noften included in the same structure. More detail about time tranching and the related\nplanned amortization/support tranche structure is included later in this review when we\ndiscuss the structures of mortgage-backed securities.\n"}
