{"id": 3425, "text": "6. Costs and benefits of holding the asset. If there are benefits of holding the\nunderlying asset (dividend or interest payments on securities or a convenience yield\non commodities), call values are decreased and put values are increased. The reason\nfor this is most easily understood by considering cash benefits. When a stock pays a\ndividend, or a bond pays interest, this reduces the value of the asset. Decreases in the\nvalue of the underlying asset decrease call values and increase put values.\nPositive storage costs make it more costly to hold an asset. We can think of this as\nmaking a call option more valuable because call holders can have long exposure to\nthe asset without paying the costs of actually owning the asset. Puts, on the other\nhand, are less valuable when storage costs are higher.\n"}
