{"id": 2312, "text": "study showed that it only took about 12 to 18 stocks in a portfolio to achieve 90% of\nthe maximum diversification possible. Another study indicated it took 30 securities.\nWhatever the number, it is significantly less than all the securities. Figure 5 provides a\ngeneral representation of this concept. Note, in the figure, that once you get to 30 or so\nsecurities in a portfolio, the standard deviation remains constant. The remaining risk is\nsystematic, or nondiversifiable, risk. We will develop this concept later when we discuss\nbeta, a measure of systematic risk.\nFigure 5: Risk vs. Number of Portfolio Assets\no (Risk)\n"}
