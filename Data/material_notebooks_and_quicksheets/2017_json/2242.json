{"id": "2242", "text": "The term P1,2 is called the correlation coefficient between the returns of securities 1 and 2.\nThe correlation coefficient has no units. It is a pure measure of the co-movement of the\ntwo stocks' returns and is bounded by -1 and +1.\nHow should you interpret the correlation coefficient?\n\u2022 A correlation coefficient of +1 means that deviations from the mean or expected\nreturn are always proportional in the same direction. That is, they are perfectly\npositively correlated.\nA correlation coefficient of -1 means that deviations from the mean or expected\nreturn are always proportional in opposite directions. That is, they are perfectly\nnegatively correlated.\nA correlation coefficient of zero means that there is no linear relationship between\nthe two stocks' returns. They are uncorrelated. One way to interpret a correlation\n(or covariance) of zero is that, in any period, knowing the actual value of one\nvariable tells you nothing about the value of the other.\n"}
