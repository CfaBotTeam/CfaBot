{"id": "3164", "text": "Note that modified duration is a linear estimate of the relation between a bond's price\nand YTM, whereas the actual relation is convex, not linear. This means that the modified\nduration measure provides good estimates of bond prices for small changes in yield, but\nincreasingly poor estimates for larger changes in yield as the effect of the curvature of the\nprice-yield curve is more pronounced.\n"}
