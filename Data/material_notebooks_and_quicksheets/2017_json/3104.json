{"id": "3104", "text": "Professor's Note: The reason that the holder-of-record date is two business days\nafter the ex-dividend date has to do with the fact that the settlement date for\nstocks is three business days after the trade date (t + 3). If an investor buys a\nstock the day before the ex-dividend date, the trade will settle three business days\nlater on the holder-of-record date, and the investor will receive the dividend.\n"}
