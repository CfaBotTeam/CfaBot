In choosing which asset classes to consider\nwhen developing the strategic asset allocation for the account, the correlations of returns\nwithin an asset class should be relatively high, indicating that the assets within the class\nare similar in their investment performance. On the other hand, it is low correlations of\nreturns between asset classes that leads to risk reduction through portfolio diversification.\n"}
