{"id": "3358", "text": "The second type of arbitrage requires an investment. If a portfolio of securities or assets\nwill have a certain payoff in the future, there is no risk in investing in that portfolio. In\norder to prevent profitable arbitrage, it must be the case that the return on the portfolio\nis the risk free rate. If the certain return on the portfolio is greater than the risk free rate,\nthe arbitrage would be to borrow at Rf, invest in the portfolio, and keep the excess of the\nportfolio return above the risk free rate that must be paid on the loan. If the portfolio's\ncertain return is less than Rf, we could sell the portfolio, invest the proceeds at Rf, and\nearn more than it will cost to buy back the portfolio at a future date.\n"}
