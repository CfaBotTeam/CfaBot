{"id": 220, "text": "Don't let the cumbersome notation obscure the simple logic of this result. If an\ninterest rate increase will occur 40% of the time and lead to a recession 70% of the\ntime when it occurs, the joint probability of an interest rate increase and a resulting\nrecession is (0.4)(0.7) = (0.28) = 28%.\n"}
