{"id": "904", "text": "Step 2: Find the present value of PV2.\nInput the relevant data and solve for PV,.\nN = 2; I/Y = 9; PMT = 0; FV = -323.97; CPT + PV = PV, = $272.68\nIn this solution, the annuity was treated as an ordinary annuity. The PV was\ncomputed one period before the first payment, and we discounted PV, = $323.97\nover two years. We need to stress this important point. The PV annuity function on\nyour calculator set in \u201cEND\u201d mode gives you the value one period before the annuity\nbegins. Although the annuity begins at t = 3, we discounted the result for only two\nperiods to get the present (t = 0) value.\n"}
