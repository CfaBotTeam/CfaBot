Just\nremember that the standard deviation of the mean of many observations is less\nthan the standard deviation of a single observation. If the standard deviation\nof monthly stock returns is 2%, the standard error (deviation) of the average\nmonthly return over the next six months is 2% I16 = 0.82%. The average\nof several observations of a random variable will be less widely dispersed\n(have lower standard deviation) around the expected value than will a single\nobservation of the random variable.\n"}
