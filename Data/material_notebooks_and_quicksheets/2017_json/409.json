{"id": 409, "text": "LOS 10.\nA continuous uniform distribution is one where the probability of X occurring in a\npossible range is the length of the range relative to the total of all possible values. Letting\na and b be the lower and upper limit of the uniform distribution, respectively, then for:\nasx, sx, sb, P(x1 <X<x2) = (x2-x1)\n(b-a)\nLOS 10.)\nThe normal probability distribution and normal curve have the following characteristics:\nThe normal curve is symmetrical and bell-shaped with a single peak at the exact\ncenter of the distribution.\nMean = median = mode, and all are in the exact center of the distribution.\nThe normal distribution can be completely defined by its mean and standard\ndeviation because the skew is always zero and kurtosis is always 3.\n\u00a92016 Kaplan, Inc.\n"}
