The sum of these inflows and outflows is the\ncompany's CFO. The direct method gives the analyst more information than the indirect\nmethod. The analyst can see the actual amounts that went to each use of cash and that\nwere received from each source of cash. This information can help the analyst to better\nunderstand the firm's performance over time and to forecast future cash flows.\n"}
