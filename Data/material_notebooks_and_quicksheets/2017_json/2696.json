{"id": 2696, "text": "If an investor estimates the expected return on a stock to be greater than her minimum\nrequired rate of return on the shares, given their risk, then the shares are an attractive\ninvestment. Investors can have different required rates of return for a given risk,\ndifferent estimates of a firm's future cash flows, and different estimates of the risk of a\nfirm's equity shares. A firm's cost of equity can be interpreted as the minimum rate of\nreturn required by investors (in the aggregate) to compensate them for the risk of the\nfirm's equity shares.\n"}
