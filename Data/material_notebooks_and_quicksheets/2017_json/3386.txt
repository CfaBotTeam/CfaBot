{"id": 3386, "text": "If the forward price were F,(T)+, a price greater than Sg (1 + Rf)\", an arbitrageur could\ntake a short position in the forward contract, promising to sell the asset at time T'at\nF(T)+, and buy the asset at S, , with funds borrowed at Rf, which requires no cash\ninvestment in the position. At time T, the arbitrageur would deliver the asset and receive\nF,(T)+, repay the loan at a cost of S,(1 + Rf), and keep the positive difference between\nF(T)+ and S,(1 + RF)T.\nIf the forward price were F,(T)-, a price less than Sg(1 + Rf)\", a profit could be earned\nwith the opposite transactions, short selling the asset for Sg , investing the proceeds at\nRf, and taking a long position in the forward. At time T, the arbitrageur would receive\nS,(1 + Rf)\" from investing the proceeds of the short sale, pay F,(T)- to purchase the\nasset and cover the short asset position, and keep the difference between S, (1 + Rf)T\nand F,(T)-. This process is the mechanism that ensures F,(T) is the (no-arbitrage) price\nin a forward contract that has zero value at T = 0.\nWhen the forward is priced at its no-arbitrage price the value of the forward at\ninitiation,\nFo (T)\nVo(T) = So --\nF(T)\nT = 0, because So ==\n(1+ Rf)T\n(1 + Rf)T\u00b0\n"}
