{"id": "3788", "text": "A par bond yield curve, or par curve, is not calculated from yields on actual bonds but\nis constructed from the spot curve. The yields reflect the coupon rate that a hypothetical\nbond at each maturity would need to have to be priced at par. Alternatively, they can be\nviewed as the YTM of a par bond at each maturity.\nConsider a 3-year annual-pay bond and spot rates for one, two, and three years of S., S2,\nand S3. The following equation can be used to calculate the coupon rate necessary for\nthe bond to be trading at par.\nPMT\nPMT +100\n1+SI\" (1+s,)2\n(1+s3)\nWith spot rates of 1%, 2%, and 3%, a 3-year annual par bond will have a payment that\nwill satisfy:\nPMT PMT PMT+100\n0=100 , so the payment is 2.96 and the par bond coupon\n\"(1.02)? (1.03)\u00b0\nrate is 2.96%.\n"}
