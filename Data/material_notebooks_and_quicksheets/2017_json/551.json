{"id": "551", "text": "Statistical significance does not necessarily imply economic significance. For example, we\nmay have tested a null hypothesis that a strategy of going long all the stocks that satisfy\nsome criteria and shorting all the stocks that do not satisfy the criteria resulted in returns\nthat were less than or equal to zero over a 20-year period. Assume we have rejected the\nnull in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the returns to the strategy are greater than\nzero (positive). This does not necessarily mean that investing in that strategy will result in\neconomically meaningful positive returns. Several factors must be considered.\n"}
