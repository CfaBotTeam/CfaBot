{"id": 3500, "text": "Indexed zero-coupon bonds. The payment at maturity is adjusted for inflation.\nInterest-indexed bonds. The coupon rate is adjusted for inflation while the principal\nvalue remains unchanged.\nCapital-indexed bonds. This is the most common structure. An example is U.S.\nTreasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). The coupon rate remains constant,\nand the principal value of the bonds is increased by the rate of inflation (or\ndecreased by deflation).\nTo better understand the structure of capital-indexed bonds, consider a bond with a par\nvalue of $1,000 at issuance, a 3% annual coupon rate paid semiannually, and a provision\nthat the principal value will be adjusted for inflation (or deflation). If six months after\nissuance the reported inflation has been 1% over the period, the principal value of the\nbonds is increased by 1% from $1,000 to $1,010, and the six-month coupon of 1.5% is\ncalculated as 1.5% of the new (adjusted) principal value of $1,010 (i.e., 1,010 x 1.5%\n=$15.15).\n"}
