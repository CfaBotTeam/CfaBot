{"id": 512, "text": "C. The sample mean has all of these properties.\n3. A,B. This is a bit tricky. We have no direct information about the distribution of possible\nearnings for the next period. We have information about the distribution of analysts'\nestimates of next period earnings. Based on the information given, we can make no\nstatement about the 90% confidence interval for earnings next period.\nC. Since we cannot assume that the distribution of analyst estimates is normal, we cannot\nmake any inferences about the mean of the population of analyst estimates with a sample\nsize of only 15.\nD. With a sample size of 60, we can make a statement about a confidence interval for\nthe mean of the population of analyst estimates. The t-statistic for a 90% confidence\ninterval with 59 degrees of freedom is approximated by using the value for 60 degrees of\nfreedom, which is 1.671.\nThe confidence interval is 2.8441.671040, or $2.75 to $2.93. We are 90%\nconfident the true mean of the population of analyst estimates is within this range.\n"}
