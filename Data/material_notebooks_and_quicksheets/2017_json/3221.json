{"id": "3221", "text": "Some bonds pay no interest prior to maturity and are called zero-coupon bonds or pure\ndiscount bonds. Pure discount refers to the fact that these bonds are sold at a discount\nto their par value and the interest is all paid at maturity when bondholders receive the\npar value. A 10-year, $1,000, zero-coupon bond yielding 7% would sell at about $500\ninitially and pay $1,000 at maturity. We discuss various other coupon structures later in\nthis topic review.\n"}
