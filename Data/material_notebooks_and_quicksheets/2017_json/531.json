{"id": 531, "text": "For a one-tailed hypothesis test of the population mean, the null and alternative\nhypotheses are either:\nUpper tail: Ho: p < Ho versus H: p > Ho, or\nLower tail: Hy: p > Ho versus H: p < Po\nThe appropriate set of hypotheses depends on whether we believe the population mean,\n, to be greater than (upper tail) or less than (lower tail) the hypothesized value, proUsing a z-test at the 5% level of significance, the computed test statistic is compared\nwith the critical values of 1.645 for the upper tail tests (i.e., H: u > Po) or -1.645 for\nlower tail tests (i.e., H: < po). These critical values are obtained from a z-table, where\n-20.05 = -1.645 corresponds to a cumulative probability equal to 5%, and the 20.05 =\n1.645 corresponds to a cumulative probability of 95% (1 - 0.05).\n"}
