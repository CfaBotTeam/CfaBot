{"id": 1258, "text": "We address the question of how a change in exchange rates affects a country's balance of\ntrade using two approaches. The elasticities approach focuses on the impact of exchange\nrate changes on the total value of imports and on the total value of exports. Because a\ntrade deficit (surplus) must be offset by a surplus (deficit) in the capital account, we can\nalso view the effects of a change in exchange rates on capital flows rather than on goods\nlows. The absorption approach to analyzing the effect of a change in exchange rates\nfocuses on capital flows.\n"}
