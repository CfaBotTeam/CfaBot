{"id": "1464", "text": "The LM curve is drawn for a given level of the real money supply, M/P. Holding the\nnominal money supply, M, constant, an increase in the price level decreases the real\nmoney supply and a decrease in the price level increases the real money supply. Because\nan increase (decrease) in the real money supply shifts the LM curve downward (upward),\nwe can identify the different combinations of income and real interest rates consistent\nwith equilibrium for different price levels. The intuition here is that a greater real money\nsupply reduces equilibrium real interest rates and shifts the LM curve, as illustrated in\nFigure 5.\n"}
