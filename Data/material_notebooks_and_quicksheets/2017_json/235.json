{"id": 235, "text": "The probabilities for a poor, normal, and good economy are unconditional probabilities.\nThe probabilities of rate increases are conditional probabilities (e.g., Prob (increase in\nrates | poor economy) = 20%). The third column has joint probabilities (e.g., Prob (poor\neconomy and increase in rates) = 6%). The unconditional probability of a rate increase is\nthe sum of the joint probabilities, 6% + 20% + 14% = 40% = Prob (increase in rates).\n"}
