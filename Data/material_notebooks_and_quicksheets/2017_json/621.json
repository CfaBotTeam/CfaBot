{"id": "621", "text": "3. The hypothesis does not involve the parameters of the distribution, such as testing\nwhether a variable is normally distributed. We can use a nonparametric test, called a\nruns test, to determine whether data are random. A runs test provides an estimate of\nthe probability that a series of changes (e.g., +, +, -, -, +, -....) are random.\nThe Spearman rank correlation test can be used when the data are not normally\ndistributed. Consider the performance ranks of 20 mutual funds for two years. The\nranks (1 through 20) are not normally distributed, so a standard t-test of the correlations\nis not appropriate. A large positive value of the Spearman rank correlations, such as\n0.85, would indicate that a high (low) rank in one year is associated with a high (low)\nrank in the second year. Alternatively, a large negative rank correlation would indicate\nthat a high rank in year 1 suggests a low rank in year 2, and vice versa.\n"}
