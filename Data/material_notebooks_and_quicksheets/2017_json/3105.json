{"id": 3105, "text": "A share repurchase is a transaction in which a company buys back shares of its own\ncommon stock. Companies use three methods to repurchase shares:\n1. Buy in the open market. Companies may repurchase stock in the open market\nat the prevailing market price. A share repurchase is authorized by the board of\ndirectors for a certain number of shares. Buying in the open market gives the\ncompany the flexibility to choose the timing of the transaction.\n2. Buy a fixed number of shares at a fixed price. A company may repurchase stock\nby making a tender offer to repurchase a specific number of shares at a price that\nis usually at a premium to the current market price. Shareholders may tender their\nshares according to the terms of the offer. If shareholders try to tender more shares\nthan the total repurchase, the company will typically buy back a pro rata amount\nfrom each shareholder. The company may select a tender offer price or use a Dutch\nauction (described in the Economics prerequisite readings) to determine the lowest\nprice at which it can repurchase the number of shares desired.\nRepurchase by direct negotiation. Companies may negotiate directly with a large\nshareholder to buy back a block of shares, usually at a premium to the market price.\nA company may engage in direct negotiation in order to keep a large block of shares\nfrom coming into the market and reducing the stock price or to repurchase shares\nfrom a potential acquirer after an unsuccessful takeover attempt. If the firm pays\nmore than market value for the shares, the result is an increase in wealth for the\nseller and an equal decrease in wealth for remaining firm shareholders.\n"}
