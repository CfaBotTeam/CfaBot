{"id": 3247, "text": "An example of a factor that rating agencies consider when notching an issue credit\nrating is structural subordination. In a holding company structure, both the parent\ncompany and the subsidiaries may have outstanding debt. A subsidiary's debt covenants\nmay restrict the transfer of cash or assets \u201cupstream\u201d to the parent company before the\nsubsidiary's debt is serviced. In such a case, even though the parent company's bonds are\nnot junior to the subsidiary's bonds, the subsidiary's bonds have a priority claim to the\nsubsidiary's cash flows. Thus the parent company's bonds are effectively subordinated to\nthe subsidiary's bonds.\nNotching is less common for highly rated issuers than for lower-rated issuers. For lowerrated issuers, higher default risk leads to significant differences between recovery rates of\ndebt with different seniority, leading to more notching.\n"}
