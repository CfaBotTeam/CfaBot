{"id": "889", "text": "FV = PV(1 + I/Y)N\nwhere:\nPV = amount of money invested today (the present value)\nI/Y = rate of return per compounding period\nN = total number of compounding periods\nIn this expression, the investment involves a single cash outflow, PV, which occurs\ntoday, at t = 0 on the time line. The single sum FV formula will determine the value\nof an investment at the end of N compounding periods, given that it can earn a fully\ncompounded rate of return, I/Y, over all of the periods.\n"}
