{"id": "349", "text": "A discrete uniform random variable is one for which the probabilities for all possible\noutcomes for a discrete random variable are equal. For example, consider the discrete\nuniform probability distribution defined as X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, p(x) = 0.2. Here, the\nprobability for each outcome is equal to 0.2 [i.e., p(1) = p(2) = p(3) = p(4) = p(5) = 0.2).\nAlso, the cumulative distribution function for the nth outcome, F(x) = np(x), and the\nprobability for a range of outcomes is p(x)k, where k is the number of possible outcomes\nin the range.\n"}
