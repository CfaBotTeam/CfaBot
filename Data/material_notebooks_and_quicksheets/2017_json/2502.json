{"id": "2502", "text": "Stop Orders\nStop orders are those that are not executed unless the stop price has been met. They\nare often referred to as stop loss orders because they can be used to prevent losses or to\nprotect profits. Suppose an investor purchases a stock for $50. If the investor wants to\nsell out of the position if the price falls 10% to $45, he can enter a stop-sell order at\n$45. If the stock trades down to $45 or lower, this triggers a market order to sell. There is\nno guarantee that the order will execute at $45, and a rapidly falling stock could be sold\nat a price significantly lower than $45.\n"}
