A noncyclical firm has earnings that are less dependent on the business cycle. Industries can\nalso be classified as cyclical or non-cyclical. Non-cyclical industries or firms can be\nclassified as defensive (demand for the product tends not to Auctuate with the business\ncycle) or growth (demand is so strong that it is largely unaffected by the business cycle).\nLimitations of descriptors such as growth, defensive, and cyclical include the facts\nthat cyclical industries often include growth firms; even non-cyclical industries can\nbe affected by severe recessions; defensive industries are not always safe investments;\nbusiness cycle timing differs across countries and regions; and the classification of firms\nis somewhat arbitrary.\nLOS 49.d\nA peer group should consist of companies with similar business activities, demand\ndrivers, cost structure drivers, and availability of capital. To form a peer group, the\nanalyst will often start by identifying companies in the same industry, but the analyst\nshould use other information to verify that the firms in an industry are comparable.\n"}
