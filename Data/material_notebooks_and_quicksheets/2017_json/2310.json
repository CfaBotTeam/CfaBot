{"id": 2310, "text": "When an investor diversifies across assets that are not perfectly correlated, the portfolio's\nrisk is less than the weighted average of the risks of the individual securities in the\nportfolio. The risk that is eliminated by diversification is called unsystematic risk (also\ncalled unique, diversifiable, or firm-specific risk). Because the market portfolio contains\nall risky assets, it must be a well-diversified portfolio. All the risk that can be diversified\naway has been. The risk that remains cannot be diversified away and is called the\nsystematic risk (also called nondiversifiable risk or market risk).\nThe concept of systematic risk applies to individual securities as well as to portfolios.\nSome securities' returns are highly correlated with overall market returns. Examples of\nfirms that are highly correlated with market returns are luxury goods manufacturers\nsuch as Ferrari automobiles and Harley Davidson motorcycles. These firms have high\nsystematic risk (i.e., they are very responsive to market, or systematic, changes). Other\nfirms, such as utility companies, respond very little to changes in the systematic risk\nfactors. These firms have very little systematic risk. Hence, total risk (as measured by\nstandard deviation) can be broken down into its component parts: unsystematic risk and\nsystematic risk. Mathematically:\ntotal risk = systematic risk + unsystematic risk\n"}
