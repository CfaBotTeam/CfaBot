{"id": 652, "text": "18. A The F-test is appropriate to the equality of population variances. The decision rule is to\nreject H, if the computed test statistic, F, exceeds the critical F-value at a/ 2. For the\ninformation provided, F = s; / Si = 36 | 25 = 1.44. At a 0.025 level of significance with\nd = 24 and d, = 35, F-critical = 2.18. Since F< F-critical (1.44 < 2.18), we fail to reject\nthe null hypothesis.\n"}
