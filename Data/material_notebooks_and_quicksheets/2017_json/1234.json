{"id": "1234", "text": "Consider a USD/EUR exchange rate that has changed from 1.42 to 1.39 USD/EUR.\nThe percentage change in the USD price of a euro is simply 1.397 1.42 - 1 = -0.0211\n= -2.11%. Because the USD price of a euro has fallen, the euro has depreciated relative\nto the dollar, and a euro now buys 2.11% fewer U.S. dollars. It is correct to say that the\nEUR has depreciated by 2.11% relative to the USD.\nOn the other hand, it is not correct to say that the USD has appreciated by 2.11%. To\ncalculate the percentage appreciation of the USD, we need to convert the quotes to\nEUR/USD. So our beginning quote of 1.42 USD/EUR becomes 1/1.42 USD/EUR =\n0.7042 EUR/USD, and our ending quote of 1.39 USD/EUR becomes 1/1.39 USDI\nEUR = 0.7194 EUR/USD. Using these exchange rates, we can calculate the change in\nthe euro price of a USD as 0.7194 / 0.7042 - 1 = 0.0216 = 2.16%. In this case, it is\ncorrect to say that the USD has appreciated 2.16% with respect to the EUR. For the\nsame quotes, the percentage appreciation of the USD is not the same as the percentage\ndepreciation in the EUR.\n"}
