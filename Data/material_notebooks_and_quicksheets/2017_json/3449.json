{"id": 3449, "text": "In practice, we would construct a binomial model with many short periods and have\nmany possible outcomes at expiration. However, the one-period model is sufficient to\nunderstand the concept and method. Note that the actual probabilities of an up move\nand a down move do not enter directly into our calculation of option value. The size of\nthe up-move and down-move, along with the risk-free rate, determine the risk-neutral\nprobabilities we use to calculate the expected payoff at option expiration. Remember, the\nrisk-neutral probabilities come from constructing a hedge that creates a certain payoff.\nBecause their calculation is based on an arbitrage relationship, we can discount the\nexpected payoff based on risk-neutral probabilities, at the risk-free rate.\n"}
