{"id": "3349", "text": "In the simplest type of swap, a plain vanilla interest rate swap, one party makes fixedrate interest payments on a notional principal amount specified in the swap in return\nfor floating-rate payments from the other party. A basis swap involves trading one set\nof floating rate payments for another. In a plain vanilla interest rate swap, the party\nwho wants floating-rate interest payments agrees to pay fixed-rate interest and has\nthe pay-fixed side of the swap. The counterparty, who receives the fixed payments and\nagrees to pay variable-rate interest, has the pay-floating side of the swap and is called the\nfloating-rate payer. The payments owed by one party to the other are based on a notional\nprincipal that is stated in the swap contract.\n"}
