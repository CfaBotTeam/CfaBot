{"id": 687, "text": "Stochastic oscillator. A stochastic oscillator is calculated from the latest closing\nprice and highest and lowest prices reached in a recent period, such as 14 days.\nIn a sustainable uptrend, prices tend to close nearer to the recent high, and in a\nsustainable downtrend, prices tend to close nearer to the recent low. Stochastic\noscillators use two lines that are bounded by 0 and 100. The \u201c%K\u201d line is the\ndifference between the latest price and the recent low as a percentage of the\ndifference between the recent high and low. The \u201c%D\u201d line is a 3-period average\nof the %K line. Technical analysts typically use stochastic oscillators to identify\noverbought and oversold markets. Points where the %K line crosses the %D line can\nalso be used as trading signals in the same way as the MACD lines.\n"}
