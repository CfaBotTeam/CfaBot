{"id": 1403, "text": "Regulators often attempt to increase competition and efficiency through efforts to\nreduce artificial barriers to trade, such as licensing requirements, quotas, and tariffs.\nBecause monopolists produce less than the optimal quantity (do not achieve efficient\nresource allocation), government regulation may be aimed at improving resource\nallocation by regulating the prices monopolies may charge. This may be done through\naverage cost pricing or marginal cost pricing.\nAverage cost pricing is the most common form of regulation. This would result in a\nprice of Pac and an output of Qac as illustrated in Figure 22. It forces monopolists to\nreduce price to where the firm's ATC intersects the market demand curve. This will:\n\u2022 Increase output and decrease price.\nIncrease social welfare (allocative efficiency).\nEnsure the monopolist a normal profit because price = ATC.\nMarginal cost pricing, which is also referred to as efficient regulation, forces the\nmonopolist to reduce price to the point where the firm's MC curve intersects the market\ndemand curve. This increases output and reduces price, but causes the monopolist to\nincur a loss because price is below ATC, as illustrated in Figure 22. Such a solution\n"}
