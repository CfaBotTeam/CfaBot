{"id": "1824", "text": "An increase in interest expense as proportion of EBIT will increase the interest burden\n(i.e., decrease the interest burden ratio). Increases in either the tax burden or the interest\nburden (i.e., decreases in the ratios) will tend to decrease ROE.\nEBIT in the second two expressions can be replaced by operating earnings. In this case,\nwe have the operating margin rather than the EBIT margin. The interest burden term\nwould then show the effects of nonoperating income as well as the effect of interest\nexpense.\n"}
