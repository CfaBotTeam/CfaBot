{"id": 824, "text": "4. B Failing to act when required by one's professional obligations, such as neglecting to\nperform due diligence related to an investment recommendation, violates Standard I (D)\nMisconduct. Acts a member commits outside his professional capacity are misconduct\nif they reflect poorly on the member or candidate's honesty, integrity, or competence\n(e.g., theft or fraud). Violations of the law that do not reflect on the member or\ncandidate's honesty, integrity, or competence (e.g., an act related to civil disobedience)\nare not necessarily regarded as misconduct.\n5. A The statement from the CFO about the current quarter's earnings is material nonpublic\ninformation. Ingus violated Standard II(A) Material Nonpublic Information by acting or\ncausing others to act on it.\n6. B The intent of Green Brothers' actions is to manipulate the appearance of market\nliquidity in order to attract investment to its own funds. The increased trading activity\nwas not based on market fundamentals or an actual trading strategy to benefit investors.\nIt was merely an attempt to mislead market participants in order to increase assets under\nGreen Brothers' management. The action violates Standard II(B) Market Manipulation.\n7. C Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care specifies that for the manager of a pension\nor trust, the duty of loyalty is owed to the beneficiaries, not to the individuals who hired\nthe manager.\n8. B The firm must give its clients an opportunity to act on recommendation changes. Firms\ncan offer different levels of service to clients as long as this is disclosed to all clients.\nThe largest institutional clients would likely be paying higher fees for a greater level of\nservice. The portfolio manager's brother's account should be treated the same as any\nother client account.\n"}
