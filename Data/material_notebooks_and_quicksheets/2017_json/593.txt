{"id": 593, "text": "State the decision rule regarding the hypothesis. There are 39 - 1 = 38 degrees of\nfreedom. Using the t-distribution, the two-tailed critical t-values for a 5% level of\nsignificance with df = 38 is +2.024. As indicated in the following table, the critical\nt-value of 2.024 is located at the intersection of the p = 0.025 column and the df = 38\nrow. The one-tailed probability of 0.025 is used because we need 2.5% in each tail for\n5% significance with a two-tailed test.\n"}
