{"id": 2144, "text": "Many types of institutions have large investment portfolios. An endowment is a fund\nthat is dedicated to providing financial support on an ongoing basis for a specific\npurpose. For example, in the United States, many universities have large endowment\nfunds to support their programs. A foundation is a fund established for charitable\npurposes to support specific types of activities or to fund research related to a particular\ndisease. A typical foundation's investment objective is to fund the activity or research on\na continuing basis without decreasing the real (inflation adjusted) value of the portfolio\nassets. Foundations and endowments typically have long investment horizons, high\nrisk tolerance, and, aside from their planned spending needs, little need for additional\nliquidity.\nThe investment objective of a bank, simply put, is to earn more on the bank's loans and\ninvestments than the bank pays for deposits of various types. Banks seek to keep risk low\nand need adequate liquidity to meet investor withdrawals as they occur.\n"}
