{"id": 3326, "text": "Two other methods of internal credit enhancement are a cash reserve fund and an excess\nspread account. A cash reserve fund is cash set aside to make up for credit losses on the\nunderlying assets. With an excess spread account, the yield promised on the bonds\nissued is less than the promised yield on the assets supporting the ABS. This gives some\nprotection if the yield on the financial assets is less than anticipated. If the assets perform\nas anticipated, the excess cash flow from the collateral can be used to retire (pay off the\nprincipal on) some of the outstanding bonds.\n"}
