{"id": 2006, "text": "Financial Ratios\nCapitalizing an expenditure initially results in higher assets and higher equity compared\nto expensing. Thus, both the debt-to-assets ratio and the debt-to-equity ratio are lower\n(they have larger denominators) with capitalization.\nCapitalizing an expenditure will initially result in higher return on assets (ROA) and\nhigher return on equity (ROE). This is the result of higher net income in the first year.\nIn subsequent years, ROA and ROE will be lower for a capitalizing firm because net\nincome is reduced by the depreciation expense.\n"}
