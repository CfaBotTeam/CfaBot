{"id": "2830", "text": "This P/E based on fundamentals is also referred to as a justified P/E. It is \u201cjustified\u201d\nbecause, assuming we have the correct inputs for D, E, k., and g, the equation above\nwill provide a P/E ratio that is based on the present value of the future cash flows. We\nrefer to this as a leading P/E ratio because it is based on expected earnings next period,\nnot on actual earnings for the previous period, which would produce a lagging or trailing\nPIE ratio.\n"}
