{"id": 157, "text": "A distribution is symmetrical if it is shaped identically on both sides of its mean.\nDistributional symmetry implies that intervals of losses and gains will exhibit the same\nfrequency. For example, a symmetrical distribution with a mean return of zero will have\nlosses in the -6% to -4% interval as frequently as it will have gains in the +4% to +6%\ninterval. The extent to which a returns distribution is symmetrical is important because\nthe degree of symmetry tells analysts if deviations from the mean are more likely to be\npositive or negative.\n"}
