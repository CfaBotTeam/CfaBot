{"id": "2011", "text": "Depreciation is the systematic allocation of an asset\u2019s cost over time. Two important\nterms are:\nCarrying (book) value. The net value of an asset or liability on the balance sheet.\nFor property, plant, and equipment, carrying value equals historical cost minus\naccumulated depreciation.\nHistorical cost. The original purchase price of the asset including installation and\ntransportation costs. Historical cost is also known as gross investment in the asset.\nDepreciation is a real and significant operating expense. Even though depreciation\ndoesn't require current cash expenditures (the cash outflow was made in the past when\nthe asset was purchased), it is an expense nonetheless and cannot be ignored.\nThe analyst must decide whether the reported depreciation expense is more or less\nthan economic depreciation, which is the actual decline in the value of the asset over\nthe period. One chain of video rental stores was found to be overstating income\nby depreciating its stock of movies by equal amounts each year. In fact, a greater\nportion of the decrease in the value of newly released movies occurs in the first year.\nDepreciating the rental assets by a greater amount during the first year would have better\napproximated economic depreciation and reduced reported income.\n"}
