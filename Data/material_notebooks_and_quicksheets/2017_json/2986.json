{"id": "2986", "text": "A company increases its value and creates wealth for its shareholders by earning more on\nits investment in assets than is required by those who provide the capital for the firm.\nA firm's WACC may increase as larger amounts of capital are raised. Thus, its marginal\ncost of capital, the cost of raising additional capital, can increase as larger amounts are\ninvested in new projects. This is illustrated by the upward-sloping marginal cost of\ncapital curve in Figure 1. Given the expected returns (IRRs) on potential projects, we\ncan order the expenditures on additional projects from highest to lowest IRR. This will\nallow us to construct a downward sloping investment opportunity schedule, such as that\nshown in Figure 1.\n"}
