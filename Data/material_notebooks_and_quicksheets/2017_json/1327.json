{"id": "1327", "text": "While plant size is fixed in the short run, in the long run, firms can choose their most\nprofitable scale of operations. Because the long-run average total cost (LRATC) curve is\ndrawn for many different plant sizes or scales of operation, each point along the curve\nrepresents the minimum ATC for a given plant size or scale of operations. In Figure 7,\nwe show a firm's LRATC curve along with short-run average total cost (SRATC) curves\nfor many different plant sizes, with SRATC +1 representing a larger scale of operations\nthan SRATC,\nWe draw the LRATC curve as U-shaped. Average total costs first decrease with larger\nscale and eventually increase. The lowest point on the LRATC corresponds to the scale\nor plant size at which the average total cost of production is at a minimum. This scale is\nsometimes called the minimum efficient scale. Under perfect competition, firms must\noperate at minimum efficient scale in long-run equilibrium, and LRATC will equal the\nmarket price. Recall that under perfect competition, firms earn zero economic profit\nin long-run equilibrium. Firms that have chosen a different scale of operations with\n"}
