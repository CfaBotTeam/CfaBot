{"id": 3521, "text": "4. Equity hedge fund strategies seek to profit from long or short positions in publicly\ntraded equities and derivatives with equities as their underlying assets.\nMarket neutral: Use technical or fundamental analysis to select undervalued\nequities to be held long, and to select overvalued equities to be sold short, in\napproximately equal amounts to profit from their relative price movements\nwithout exposure to market risk.\nFundamental growth: Use fundamental analysis to find high-growth companies.\nIdentify and buy equities of companies that are expected to sustain relatively\nhigh rates of capital appreciation.\nFundamental value: Buy equity shares that are believed to be undervalued\nbased on fundamental analysis. Here it is the hedge fund structure, rather\nthan the type of assets purchased, that results in classification as an alternative\ninvestment.\nQuantitative directional: Buy equity securities believed to be undervalued and\nshort securities believed to be overvalued based on technical analysis. Market\nexposure may vary depending on relative size of long and short portfolio\npositions.\nShort bias: Employ predominantly short positions in overvalued equities,\npossibly with smaller long positions, but with negative market exposure overall.\nMany hedge funds tend to specialize in a specific strategy at first and over time may\ndevelop or add additional areas of expertise, becoming multi-strategy funds.\n"}
