{"id": 2357, "text": "risk adjustment using total risk, as with the Sharpe and M\u00ba measures, is appropriate. If a\nfund uses multiple managers so that the overall fund portfolio is well diversified (has no\nnonsystematic risk), then performance measures based on systematic (beta) risk, such as\nthe Treynor measure and Jensen's alpha, are appropriate.\nThese measures of risk-adjusted returns are often used to compare the performance of\nactively managed funds to passively managed funds. Note in Figures 10 and 11 that\nportfolios that lie above the CML have Sharpe ratios greater than those of any portfolios\nalong the CML and have positive M\u00ba measures. Similarly, in Figure 12, we can see\nthat portfolios that lie above the SML have Treynor measures greater than those of any\nsecurity or portfolio that lies along the SML and also have positive values for Jensen's\n"}
