Retail trades are typically cleared\nand settled by the broker, whereas institutional trades may be settled by a custodian or\nanother broker, which might be the trader's prime broker. Using two brokers allows the\ninvestor to keep one broker as her prime broker for margin and custodial services while\nusing a variety of other brokers for specialized execution.\n"}
