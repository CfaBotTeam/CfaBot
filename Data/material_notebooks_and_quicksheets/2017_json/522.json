{"id": "522", "text": "Exam Focus\nThe Standards of Professional Conduct comprise seven Standards (I \u2013 VII) and a total\nof 22 subsections. These Standards and their application are described in the Standards\nof Practice Handbook, 11th Edition, 2014, published by CFA Institute. We recommend\ncarefully reading the Standards of Practice Handbook multiple times in preparation for\nyour Level I exam (yes, the whole thing, including all examples). Fifteen percent of\nyour exam questions will be based on this book and the two relatively short readings\nconcerning Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS). Given that much of\nthis material must simply be memorized, we also suggest that your final reading of the\nStandards of Practice Handbook be on the Friday prior to your exam. You probably don't\nneed to read all the examples that day, but if you highlighted some points during an\nearlier reading, you can revisit those as you go through all the Standards, the guidance,\nand the recommended best practices.\n"}
