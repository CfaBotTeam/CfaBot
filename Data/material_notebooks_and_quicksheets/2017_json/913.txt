{"id": 913, "text": "Present Value of an Annuity Due\nWhile less common than those for ordinary annuities, some problems may require\nyou to find the PV of an annuity due (PVAp). Using a financial calculator, this really\nshouldn't be much of a problem. With an annuity due, there is one less discounting period\nsince the first cash flow occurs at t = 0 and thus is already its PV. This implies that, all\nelse equal, the PV of an annuity due will be greater than the PV of an ordinary annuity.\n"}
