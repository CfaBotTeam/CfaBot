{"id": "2941", "text": "Also notice in Figure 1 that the NPV profiles intersect. They intersect at the discount\nrate for which NPVs of the projects are equal, 7.2%. This rate at which the NPVs\nare equal is called the crossover rate. At discount rates below 7.2% (to the left of the\nintersection), Project B has the greater NPV, and at discount rates above 7.2%, Project\nA has a greater NPV. Clearly, the discount rate used in the analysis can determine\nwhich one of two mutually exclusive projects will be accepted.\n"}
