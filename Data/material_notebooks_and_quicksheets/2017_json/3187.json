{"id": "3187", "text": "Earlier we explained that modified duration is a linear approximation of the relationship\nbetween yield and price and that, because of the convexity of the true price-yield\nrelation, duration-based estimates of a bond's full price for a given change in YTM will\nbe increasingly different from actual prices. This is illustrated in Figure 2. Durationbased price estimates for a decrease and for an increase in YTM are shown as Est.- and\nEst.+.\n"}
