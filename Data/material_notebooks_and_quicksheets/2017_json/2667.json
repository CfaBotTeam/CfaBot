{"id": "2667", "text": "Callable common shares give the firm the right to repurchase the stock at a pre-specified\ncall price. Investors receive a fixed amount when the firm calls the stock. The call feature\nbenefits the firm because when the stock's market price is greater than the call price,\nthe firm can call the shares and reissue them later at a higher price. Calling the shares,\nsimilarly to the repurchase of shares, allows the firm to reduce its dividend payments\nwithout changing its per-share dividend.\n"}
