{"id": "1346", "text": "In a perfectly competitive market, a firm will continue to expand production until\nmarginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). Marginal revenue is the increase in\ntotal revenue from selling one more unit of a good or service. For a price taker, marginal\nrevenue is simply the price because all additional units are assumed to be sold at the\nsame (market) price. In pure competition, a firm's marginal revenue is equal to the market\nprice, and a firm's MR curve, presented in Figure 3, is identical to its demand curve. A\nprofit maximizing firm will produce the quantity, Q\u201c, when MC = MR.\n"}
