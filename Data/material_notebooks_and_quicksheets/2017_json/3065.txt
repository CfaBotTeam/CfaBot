In the unleveraged scenario, ROE varies directly with the change in EBIT. For\nan increase in EBIT of 10%, the ROE increases from 9.60% to 10.56%, for a rate of\nchange of 10%. In the leveraged scenario, ROE is more volatile. For an increase in EBIT\nof 10%, the ROE increases from 15.60% to 17.52%, for a rate of change of 12.3%.\n"}
