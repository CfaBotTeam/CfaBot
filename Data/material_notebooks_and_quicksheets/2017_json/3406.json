{"id": "3406", "text": "Note that a forward on 90-day Libor that settles 90 days from now, based on 90-day\nLibor at that time, actually pays the present value of the difference between the fixed\nrate F and 90-day Libor 90 days from now (times the notional principal amount). Thus,\nthe forwards in our above example actually pay on days 90, 180, and 270. However,\nthe amounts paid are equivalent to the differences between the fixed rate payment and\nfloating rate payment that are due when interest is actually paid on days 180, 270, and\n360, which are the amounts we used in the example.\n"}
