{"id": "3178", "text": "The first approach is theoretically correct but not often used in practice. The yield\nmeasure for calculating portfolio duration with this approach is the cash flow yield, the\nIRR of the bond portfolio. This is inconsistent with duration capturing the relationship\nbetween YTM and price. This approach will not work for a portfolio that contains\nbonds with embedded options because the future cash flows are not known with\ncertainty and depend on interest rate movements.\n"}
