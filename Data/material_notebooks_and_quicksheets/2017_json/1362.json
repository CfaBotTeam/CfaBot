{"id": "1362", "text": "Panel (b) of Figure 10 illustrates long-run equilibrium for a representative firm after new\nfirms have entered the market. As indicated, the entry of new firms shifts the demand\ncurve faced by each individual firm down to the point where price equals average total\ncost (P* = ATC\u201c), such that economic profit is zero. At this point, there is no longer an\nincentive for new firms to enter the market, and long-run equilibrium is established. The\nfirm in monopolistic competition continues to produce at the quantity where MR = MC\nbut no longer earns positive economic profits.\n"}
