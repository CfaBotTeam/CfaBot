{"id": "2354", "text": "The M-squared (M?) measure produces the same portfolio rankings as the Sharpe ratio\nbut is stated in percentage terms. It is calculated as (Rp - R) OM- (Rm - Re).\nOp\nThe intuition of this measure is that the first term is the excess return on a Portfolio\nP*, constructed by taking a leveraged position in Portfolio P so that P* has the same\ntotal risk, om, as the market portfolio. As shown in Figure 11, the excess return on such\na leveraged portfolio is greater than the return on the market portfolio by the vertical\ndistance M2.\n"}
