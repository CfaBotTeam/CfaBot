Cyclical unemployment is positive when the economy is operating at less\nthan full capacity and can be negative when an expansion leads to employment\ntemporarily over the full employment level.\nA person who is not working is considered to be unemployed if he is actively searching\nfor work. One who has been seeking work unsuccessfully for several months is referred\nto as long-term unemployed.\nThe unemployment rate is the percentage of people in the labor force who are\nunemployed. The labor force includes all people who are either employed or\nunemployed. People who choose not to be in the labor force are said to be voluntarily\nunemployed and are not included in the calculation of the unemployment rate.\n"}
