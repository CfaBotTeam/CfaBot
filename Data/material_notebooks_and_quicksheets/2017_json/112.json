{"id": 112, "text": "Unusually large or small values can have a disproportionate effect on the computed value\nfor the arithmetic mean. The mean of 1, 2, 3, and 50 is 14 and is not a good indication\nof what the individual data values really are. On the positive side, the arithmetic mean\nuses all the information available about the observations. The arithmetic mean of a\nsample from a population is the best estimate of both the true mean of the sample and\nthe value of the next observation.\nThe computation of a weighted mean recognizes that different observations may have\na disproportionate influence on the mean. The weighted mean of a set of numbers is\ncomputed with the following equation:\nKw =\u00cbw,Xi = (w,X, + W,X, t.* W,X)\ni=1\nwhere:\nX, X, ... X = observed values\nw, w, ... w, = corresponding weights associated with each of the observations\nsuch that Zw; = 1\n"}
