In this\ncontext, stratified random sampling has the advantage that the sample will have the\nsame proportion of exposure to each industry and firms of, for example, large, small,\nand medium size. If these subgroups successfully capture different risk characteristics,\ntracking error for the portfolio relative to the index can be reduced.\n2. A. She can use the sample mean to estimate the population mean. The central limit\ntheorem states that for a large enough sample size n (typically more than 30) from a\npopulation with a mean p and variance o?, the probability distribution for the sample\nmean will be approximately normal with mean p and variance o\u00ba/n. The theorem allows\nus to use the normal distribution to test hypotheses about the population mean, whether\nthe population's distribution is normal or not.\nB. An estimator should be:\nUnbiased\u2014the expected value of the estimator should be equal to the population\nparameter.\nEfficient\u2014the variance of its sampling distribution is smaller than that of all the\nother unbiased estimators of the parameter.\nConsistent\u2014the standard error of the estimator should decrease as the sample size\nincreases.\n"}
