{"id": "1328", "text": "The downward-sloping segment of the long-run average total cost curve presented in\nFigure 7 indicates that economies of scale (or increasing returns to scale) are present.\nEconomies of scale result from factors such as labor specialization, mass production,\nand investment in more efficient equipment and technology. In addition, the firm\nmay be able to negotiate lower input prices with suppliers as firm size increases and\nmore resources are purchased. A firm operating with economies of scale can increase its\ncompetitiveness by expanding production and reducing costs.\n"}
