{"id": "3398", "text": "A loan structure in which the periodic payments include both interest and some\nrepayment of principal (the amount borrowed) is called an amortizing loan. If a\nbond (loan) is fully amortizing, this means the principal is fully paid off when the\nlast periodic payment is made. Typically, automobile loans and home loans are fully\namortizing loans. If the 5-year, 5% bond in the previous table had a fully amortizing\nstructure rather than a bullet structure, the payments and remaining principal balance\nat each year-end would be as follows (final payment reflects rounding of previous\npayments).\n"}
