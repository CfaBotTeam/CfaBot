{"id": "3847", "text": "We can illustrate the basic structure of a securitization transaction with this simplified,\nfictitious example of Fred Motor Company.\nFred Motor Company sells most of its cars on retail sales installment contracts (i.e.,\nauto loans). The customers buy the automobiles, and Fred loans the customers the\nmoney for the purchase (i.e., Fred originates the loans) with the autos as collateral and\nreceives principal and interest payments on the loans until they mature. The loans have\nmaturities of 48 to 60 months at various interest rates. Fred is also the servicer of the\nloans (i.e., it collects principal and interest payments, sends out delinquency notices, and\nrepossesses and disposes of the autos if the customers do not make timely payments).\n"}
