{"id": "678", "text": "Reversal patterns occur when a trend approaches a range of prices but fails to continue\nbeyond that range. A well-known example is the head-and-shoulders pattern, as shown\nin Figure 6. This pattern suggests the demand that has been driving the uptrend is\nfading, especially if each of the highs in the pattern occurs on declining volume.\nTechnical analysts commonly use the size of a head-and-shoulders pattern to project a\nprice target for the ensuing downtrend. The size is the difference in price between the\n\u201chead,\u201d the highest price reached, and the \u201cneckline,\u201d the support level to which the\nprice retraced after the left \u201cshoulder\u201d and the head have formed. If the price declines\nbeyond the neckline after the right shoulder forms, the downtrend is projected to\ncontinue from that breakdown price by about the size of the head-and-shoulders pattern.\nIn Figure 6, the top of the head is at 80 and the neckline is at 55, so the size of the\npattern is 80 \u2013 55 = 25. The price target for the ensuing downtrend is 55 \u2013 25 = 30.\n"}
