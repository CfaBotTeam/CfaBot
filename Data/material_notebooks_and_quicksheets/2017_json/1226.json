{"id": 1226, "text": "The intuition in this example is that the USD has appreciated versus the GBP by\njust over 6.0% in nominal terms, and the price level in the U.K. has increased by\napproximately 1.8% (112/110 - 1) relative to the U.S. price level. Because the dollar has\nappreciated in nominal terms by more than the price level in the U.K. has risen relative\nto the price level in the United States, the purchasing power of one USD in terms of\nU.K. goods and services has increased. The real rate of exchange has decreased from\n$1.70/\u00a3 to $1.629/\u00a3, which is a decrease of approximately 6.0% \u2013 1.8% = 4.2%. Note\nthat the real rate of exchange is the same as the nominal rate of exchange at the base\nperiod because both CPIs are equal to 100 at that point in time.\nIt will help your understanding to examine how a change in each of the variables affects\nthe real rate. Holding other things equal:\nInflation in the U.K., by itself, increases the real $7\u00a3 exchange rate so that a unit of\nreal goods and services in the U.K. costs relatively more in USD than it did at the\nbase period.\nInflation in the U.S., by itself, decreases the real $7\u00a3 exchange rate so that a unit of\nreal goods and services in the U.K. costs relatively less in USD than it did at the base\nperiod.\nAn increase (decrease) in the nominal $7\u00a3 exchange rate when inflation in both\ncountries is equal increases (decreases) the real $7\u00a3 exchange rate, and the cost of a\nunit of real goods and services in the U.K. increases (decreases) relative to what it\nwas in the base period.\nChanges in real exchange rates can be used when analyzing economic changes over time.\nWhen the real exchange rate (d/f) increases, exports of goods and services have gotten\nrelatively less expensive to foreigners, and imports of goods and services from the foreign\ncountry have gotten relatively more expensive over time.\n"}
