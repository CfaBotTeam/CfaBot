{"id": 140, "text": "Calculated with decimals instead of whole percents, we would get:\no? = 0.00356 and o = 10.00356 = 0.05966 = 5.97%\nSince the population standard deviation and population mean are both expressed in\nthe same units (percent), these values are easy to relate. The outcome of this example\nindicates that the mean return is 22% and the standard deviation about the mean\nis 5.97%. Note that this is greater than the MAD of 4.8%, a result (o > MAD) that\nholds in general.\n"}
