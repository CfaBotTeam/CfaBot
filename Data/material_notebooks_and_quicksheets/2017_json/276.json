{"id": 276, "text": "Answer:\nThis is the simplest type of example because the most tedious calculations have\nalready been performed. Simply extract the appropriate values from the covariance\nmatrix and insert them into the variance formula.\nRecall that the covariance of an asset with itself is its variance. Thus, the terms along\nthe diagonal in the covariance matrix are return variances.\n"}
