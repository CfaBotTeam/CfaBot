{"id": "2842", "text": "Exam Focus\nIf you recollect little from your basic financial management course in college (or if\nyou didn't take one), you will need to spend some time on this review and go through\nthe examples quite carefully. To be prepared for the exam, you need to know how to\ncalculate all of the measures used to evaluate capital projects and the decision rules\nassociated with them. Be sure you can interpret an NPV profile; one could be given as\npart of a question. Finally, know the reasoning behind the facts that (1) IRR and NPV\ngive the same accept/reject decision for a single project and (2) IRR and NPV can give\nconflicting rankings for mutually exclusive projects.\n"}
