{"id": 3509, "text": "2. Private equity funds. As the name suggests, private equity funds invest in the equity\nof companies that are not publicly traded or in the equity of publicly traded firms\nthat the fund intends to take private. Leveraged buyout (LBO) funds use borrowed\nmoney to purchase equity in established companies and comprise the majority of\nprivate equity investment funds. A much smaller portion of these funds, venture\ncapital funds, invest in or finance young unproven companies at various stages\nearly in their existence. For our purposes here we will also consider investing in the\nsecurities of financially distressed companies to be private equity, although hedge\nfunds may hold these also.\n"}
