{"id": 198, "text": "Ethical principles often set a higher standard of behavior than laws and regulations.\nNew laws and regulations often result from recent instances of what is perceived to be\nunethical behavior. Just as the Securities Act of 1933, the Glass-Steagall Act, and the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 followed the perceived bad behavior by investment\nprofessionals and bankers leading to the 1929 market crash, the Sarbanes-Oxley laws\nfollowed the accounting scandals at Enron and Worldcom, and the Dodd-Frank Act\nfollowed the 2008 financial crisis. New laws and regulations can create opportunities\nfor different unethical behavior. In general, ethical decisions require more judgment\nand consideration of the impact of behavior on many stakeholders compared to legal\ndecisions.\n"}
