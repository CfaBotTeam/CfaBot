{"id": "1052", "text": "The primary objective of a central bank is to control inflation so as to promote price\nstability. High inflation is not conducive to a stable economic environment. High\ninflation leads to menu costs (i.e., cost to businesses of constantly having to change\ntheir prices) and shoe leather costs (i.e., costs to individuals of making frequent trips to\nthe bank so as to minimize their holdings of cash that are depreciating in value due to\ninflation).\nIn addition to price stability, some central banks have other stated goals, such as:\nStability in exchange rates with foreign currencies.\nFull employment.\nSustainable positive economic growth.\n\u2022 Moderate long-term interest rates.\nThe target inflation rate in most developed countries is a range around 2% to 3%. A\ntarget of zero inflation is not used because that increases the risk of deflation, which can\nbe very disruptive for an economy.\nWhile most developed countries have an explicit target inflation rate, the U.S. Fed and\nthe Bank of Japan do not. In the United States, this is because the Fed has the additional\ngoals of maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates. In Japan, it is\nbecause deflation, rather than inflation, has been a persistent problem in recent years.\n"}
