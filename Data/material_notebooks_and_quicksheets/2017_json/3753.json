{"id": "3753", "text": "To calculate the accrued interest through the August 21 settlement date on the bond in\nour example (that has coupon payment dates on June 15 and December 15), we would\ncalculate 2 x 30 = 60 days between June 15 and August 15 and then add the 6 days from\nAugust 15 to August 21 to get 66 days. Assuming 30 days per month, there are 180 days\nbetween coupon dates.\n"}
