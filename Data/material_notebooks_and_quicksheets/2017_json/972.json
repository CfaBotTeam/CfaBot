At\nt = 1 we deposit $100, so at t = 2 it has grown to $110 and the $200 deposit at t = 2\nmakes the account balance $310. Over the next period, the $310 grows to 310 x 1.1\n= $341 at t = 3, and the addition of the final $300 deposit puts the account balance at\n$641. This is, of course, the future value we calculated initially.\n"}
