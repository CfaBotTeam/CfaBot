{"id": "400", "text": "1. Specify the probability distributions of stock prices and of the relevant interest rate,\nas well as the parameters (mean, variance, possibly skewness) of the distributions.\n2. Randomly generate values for both stock prices and interest rates.\n3. Value the options for each pair of risk factor values.\n4. After many iterations, calculate the mean option value and use that as your estimate\nof the option's value.\nMonte Carlo simulation is used to:\nValue complex securities.\nSimulate the profits/losses from a trading strategy.\nCalculate estimates of value at risk (Var) to determine the riskiness of a portfolio of\nassets and liabilities.\nSimulate pension fund assets and liabilities over time to examine the variability of\nthe difference between the two.\nValue portfolios of assets that have non-normal returns distributions.\nThe limitations of Monte Carlo simulation are that it is fairly complex and will provide\nanswers that are no better than the assumptions about the distributions of the risk\nfactors and the pricing/valuation model that is used. Also, simulation is not an analytic\nmethod, but a statistical one, and cannot provide the insights that analytic methods can.\n"}
