{"id": 1246, "text": "Rearranging our formula, we have:\nforward = spor Islae and we can calculate the forward rate as\nforward = 4,5671 (1.03) = 4.6558(ABE%UB)\nNote that the forward rate is greater than the spot rate by 4.6558 / 4.5671 - 1 =\n1.94%. This is approximately equal to the interest rate differential of 5% \u2013 3%\n= 2%. The currency with the higher interest rate should depreciate over time by\napproximately the amount of the interest rate differential.\n"}
