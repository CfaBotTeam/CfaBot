{"id": 2348, "text": "Professor's Note: If the estimated return plots \"over\u201d the SML, the security is\n\u201cunder\" valued. If the estimated return plots \u201cunder\u201d the SML, the security is\n\u201cover\u201d valued.\nRemember, all stocks should plot on the SML; any stock not plotting on the SML\nis mispriced. Notice that Stock A falls below the SML, Stock B lies above the SML,\nand Stock C is on the SML. If you plot a stock's expected return and it falls below the\nSML, the stock is overpriced. That is, the stock's expected return is too low given its\nsystematic risk. If a stock plots above the SML, it is underpriced and is offering an\nexpected return greater than required for its systematic risk. If it plots on the SML,\nthe stock is properly priced.\n"}
