{"id": "2301", "text": "The line of possible portfolio risk and return combinations given the risk-free rate and\nthe risk and return of a portfolio of risky assets is referred to as the capital allocation\nline (CAL). For an individual investor, the best CAL is the one that offers the mostpreferred set of possible portfolios in terms of their risk and return. Figure 2 illustrates\nthree possible investor CALs for three different risky portfolios A, B, and C. The\noptimal risky portfolio for this investor is Portfolio A because it results in the most\npreferred set of possible portfolios constructed by combining the risk-free asset with the\nrisky portfolio. Of all the portfolios available to the investor, a combination of the riskfree asset with risky Portfolio A offers the investor the greatest expected utility.\n"}
