{"id": 1740, "text": "CFF = sale of stock + new bank note - payment of mortgage - dividends + increase in\ndividends payable = 30 + 100 \u2013 50 \u2013 10 + 5 = $75.\nCFI = sale of fixed assets \u2013 new fixed assets = 30 \u2013 100 = -$70. Don't make this difficule.\nWe sold assets for 30 and bought assets for 100. Assets sold had an original cost of 80, so\n(gross) PP&E only went up by 20.\nThe easiest way to determine total cash flow is to simply take the change in cash from\nthe balance sheet. However, adding the three components of cash flow will yield\n185 \u2013 70 + 75 = $190.\nFCFE = cash flow from operations \u2013 capital spending + sale of fixed assets + debt issued\n- debt repaid = $185 \u2013 100 + 30 + 100 \u2013 50 = $165. No adjustment is necessary for\ninterest since FCFE includes debt service.\nInvesting cash flow would be higher and financing cash flow would be lower. The\ncompany would spend less on investments but would not have inflows from the\nborrowing.\n"}
