{"id": "358", "text": "A binomial tree is constructed by showing all the possible combinations of upmoves and down-moves over a number of successive periods. For two periods, these\ncombinations are UU, UD, DU, and DD. Importantly, UD and DU result in the same\nstock price S after two periods since S (1.01)(1/1.01) = S and the order of the moves\ndoes not affect the result. Each of the possible values along a binomial tree is a node.\nFigure 2 illustrates a binomial tree for three periods.\n"}
