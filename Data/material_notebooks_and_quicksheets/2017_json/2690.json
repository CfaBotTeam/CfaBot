{"id": 2690, "text": "Higher ROE is generally viewed as a positive for a firm, but the reason for an increase\nshould be examined. For example, if book value is decreasing more rapidly than net\nincome, ROE will increase. This is not, however, a positive for the firm. A firm can also\nissue debt to repurchase equity, thereby decreasing the book value of equity. This would\nincrease the ROE but also make the firm's shares riskier due to the increased financial\nleverage (debt).\n"}
