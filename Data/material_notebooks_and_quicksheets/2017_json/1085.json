{"id": "1085", "text": "Another situation in which the transmission mechanism may not perform as expected\nis if demand for money becomes very elastic and individuals willingly hold more money\neven without a decrease in short-term rates. Such a situation is called a liquidity trap.\nIncreasing growth of the money supply will not decrease short-term rates under these\nconditions because individuals hold the money in cash balances instead of investing in\ninterest-bearing securities. If an economy is experiencing deflation even though money\nsupply policy has been expansionary, liquidity trap conditions may be present.\nCompared to inflation, deflation is more difficult for central banks to reverse. In a\ndeflationary environment, monetary policy needs to be expansionary. However, the\ncentral bank is limited to reducing the nominal policy rate to zero. Once it reaches zero,\nthe central bank has limited ability to further stimulate the economy.\n"}
