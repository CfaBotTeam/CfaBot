{"id": 111, "text": "The population mean and sample mean are both examples of arithmetic means.\nThe arithmetic mean is the sum of the observation values divided by the number\nof observations. It is the most widely used measure of central tendency and has the\nfollowing properties:\nAll interval and ratio data sets have an arithmetic mean.\nAll data values are considered and included in the arithmetic mean computation.\nA data set has only one arithmetic mean (i.e., the arithmetic mean is unique).\nThe sum of the deviations of each observation in the data set from the mean is\nalways zero.\nThe arithmetic mean is the only measure of central tendency for which the sum of the\ndeviations from the mean is zero. Mathematically, this property can be expressed as\nfollows:\n"}
