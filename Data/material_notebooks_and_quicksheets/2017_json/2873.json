{"id": "2873", "text": "Categories of Capital Budgeting Projects\nCapital budgeting projects may be divided into the following categories:\n\u2022 Replacement projects to maintain the business are normally made without detailed\nanalysis. The only issues are whether the existing operations should continue and,\nif so, whether existing procedures or processes should be maintained.\nReplacement projects for cost reduction determine whether equipment that is\nobsolete, but still usable, should be replaced. A fairly detailed analysis is necessary\nin this case.\nExpansion projects are taken on to grow the business and involve a complex\ndecision-making process because they require an explicit forecast of future\ndemand. A very detailed analysis is required.\nNew product or market development also entails a complex decision-making process\nthat will require a detailed analysis due to the large amount of uncertainty\ninvolved.\nMandatory projects may be required by a governmental agency or insurance\ncompany and typically involve safety-related or environmental concerns. These\nprojects typically generate little to no revenue, but they accompany new revenueproducing projects undertaken by the company.\nOther projects. Some projects are not easily analyzed through the capital budgeting\nprocess. Such projects may include a pet project of senior management (e.g.,\ncorporate perks) or a high-risk endeavor that is difficult to analyze with typical\ncapital budgeting assessment methods (e.g., research and development projects).\nLOS 35.b: Describe the basic principles of capital budgeting.\n"}
