{"id": "370", "text": "A confidence interval is a range of values around the expected outcome within which\nwe expect the actual outcome to be some specified percentage of the time. A 95%\nconfidence interval is a range that we expect the random variable to be in 95% of the\ntime. For a normal distribution, this interval is based on the expected value (sometimes\ncalled a point estimate) of the random variable and on its variability, which we measure\nwith standard deviation.\n"}
