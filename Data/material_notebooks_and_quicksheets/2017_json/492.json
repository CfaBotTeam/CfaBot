{"id": "492", "text": "LOS 11.h\nPoint estimates are single value estimates of population parameters. An estimator is a\nformula used to compute a point estimate.\nConfidence intervals are ranges of values, within which the actual value of the parameter\nwill lie with a given probability.\nconfidence interval = point estimate + (reliability factor x standard error)\nThe reliability factor is a number that depends on the sampling distribution of the point\nestimate and the probability that the point estimate falls in the confidence interval.\n"}
