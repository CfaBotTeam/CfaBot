{"id": 3904, "text": "Commercial mortgages are typically amortized over a period longer than the loan term;\nfor example, payments for a 20-year commercial mortgage may be determined based\non a 30-year amortization schedule. At the end of the loan term, the loan will still have\nprincipal outstanding that needs to be paid; this amount is called a balloon payment.\nIf the borrower is unable to arrange refinancing to make this payment, the borrower\nis in default. This possibility is called balloon risk. The lender will be forced to extend\nthe term of the loan during a workout period, during which time the borrower will be\ncharged a higher interest rate. Because balloon risk entails extending the term of the\nloan, it is also referred to as extension risk for CMBS.\n"}
