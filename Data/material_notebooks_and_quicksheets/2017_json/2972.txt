B The discounted payback is longer than the regular payback because cash flows are\ndiscounted to their present value.\n5. C IF IRR is less than the cost of capital, the result will be a negative NPV.\n6. B Cash flow (CF) after year 2 = -5,000 + 3,000 + 2,000 = 0. Cost of copier is paid back in\nthe first two years.\n7. c Year 1 discounted cash flow = 3,000 / 1.10 = 2,727; year 2 DCF = 2,000 / 1.102 =\n1,653; year 3 DCF = 2,000 / 1.103 = 1,503.
