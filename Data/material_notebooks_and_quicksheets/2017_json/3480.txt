{"id": 3480, "text": "The profit potential to the buyer of the option is unlimited, and, conversely, the\npotential loss to the writer of the call option is unlimited.\nThe call holder will exercise the option whenever the stock's price exceeds the strike\nprice at the expiration date.\nThe greatest profit the writer can make is the $5 premium (at any S < $50).\nThe sum of the profits between the buyer and seller of the call option is always zero;\nthus, options trading is a zero-sum game. There are no net profits or losses in the\nmarket. The long profits equal the short losses.\nFigure 1: Profit/Loss Diagram for a Call Option\n"}
