{"id": 262, "text": "Portfolio variance. The variance of the portfolio return uses the portfolio weights also,\nbut in a more complicated way:\nN N\nVar(r,) = ZZw;w;Cov(R,R;)\ni=1 j=1\nThe way this formula works, particularly in its use of the double summation operator,\nEE, is best explained using 2-asset and 3-asset portfolio examples.\nExample: Variance of a 2-asset portfolio\nSymbolically express the variance of a portfolio composed of risky asset A and risky\nasset B.\nAnswer:\nApplication of the variance formula provides the following:\nVar(R) = wAwaCov(R,R) + w wgCov(R,,R3) + wgwaCov(R3,R) + wgwgCov(R3,R\nNow, since Cov(R,,R) = Cov(R3,RA), and Cov(R,,RA) = 0?(RA), this expression\nreduces to the following:\nVar(Rp= w, o?(RA) + wg\u00b0o?(R) + 2w wgCov(R,,R3)\nSince Cov(R,R3) = O(Rg)o(RJP(R,,R3), another way to present this formula is:\nVar(Rp) = w\u00bao?(R) + wg\u00b0o?(R,) + 2wawgo (R,)o(Rg)P(R,,R2)\n"}
