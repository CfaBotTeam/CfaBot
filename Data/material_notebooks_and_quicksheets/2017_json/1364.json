{"id": 1364, "text": "In a world with only one brand of toothpaste, clearly average production costs would be\nlower. That fact alone probably does not mean that a world with only one brand/type of\ntoothpaste would be a better world. While product differentiation has costs, it also has\nbenefits to consumers.\nConsumers definitely benefit from brand name promotion and advertising because\nthey receive information about the nature of a product. This often enables consumers\nto make better purchasing decisions. Convincing consumers that a particular brand of\ndeodorant will actually increase their confidence in a business meeting or make them\nmore attractive to the opposite sex is not easy or inexpensive. Whether the perception\nof increased confidence or attractiveness from using a particular product is worth the\nadditional cost of advertising is a question probably better left to consumers of the\nproducts. Some would argue that the increased cost of advertising and sales is not\njustified by the benefits of these activities.\nProduct innovation is a necessary activity as firms in monopolistic competition pursue\neconomic profits. Firms that bring new and innovative products to the market are\nconfronted with less-elastic demand curves, enabling them to increase price and earn\neconomic profits. However, close substitutes and imitations will eventually erode\nthe initial economic profit from an innovative product. Thus, firms in monopolistic\ncompetition must continually look for innovative product features that will make their\nproducts relatively more desirable to some consumers than those of the competition.\nInnovation does not come without costs. The costs of product innovation must be\nweighed against the extra revenue that it produces. A firm is considered to be spending\nthe optimal amount on innovation when the marginal cost of (additional) innovation\njust equals the marginal revenue (marginal benefit) of additional innovation.\n"}
