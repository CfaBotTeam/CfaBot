{"id": "1884", "text": "Under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, the item purchased most recently is\nassumed to be the first item sold. In an inflationary environment, LIFO COGS will\nbe higher than FIFO COGS, and earnings will be lower. Lower earnings translate\ninto lower income taxes, which increase cash flow. Under LIFO, ending inventory\non the balance sheet is valued using the earliest costs. Therefore, in an inflationary\nenvironment, LIFO ending inventory is less than current cost.\n"}
