{"id": 3791, "text": "The Relationship between Short-Term Forward Rates and Spot Rates\nThe idea here is that borrowing for three years at the 3-year spot rate, or borrowing for oneyear periods in three successive years, should have the same cost. The S; are the current spot\nrates for i periods.\nThis relation is illustrated as (1 + S3)3 = (1 + S)(1 + lyly)(1 + 2yly). Thus, S3 =\n[(1 + S)(1 + lyly)(1 + 2yly)]1/3 \u2013 1, which is the geometric mean return we covered in\nQuantitative Methods.\n"}
