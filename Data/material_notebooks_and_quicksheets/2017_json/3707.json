{"id": "3707", "text": "Another source of short-term funding for banks is to borrow excess reserves from other\nbanks in the central bank funds market. Banks in most countries must maintain a\nportion of their funds as reserves on deposit with the central bank. At any point in time,\nsome banks may have more than the required amount of reserves on deposit, while\nothers require more reserve deposits. In the market for central bank funds, banks with\nexcess reserves lend them to other banks for periods of one day (overnight funds) and\nfor longer periods up to a year (term funds). Central bank funds rates refer to rates for\nthese transactions, which are strongly influenced by the effect of the central bank's open\nmarket operations on the money supply and availability of short-term funds.\nIn the United States, the central bank funds rate is called the Fed funds rate and this rate\ninfluences the interest rates of many short-term debt securities.\n"}
