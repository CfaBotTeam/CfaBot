{"id": "3900", "text": "The basic CMBS structure is created to meet the risk and return needs of the CMBS\ninvestor. As with residential MBS securities, rating organizations such as S&P and\nMoody's assess the credit risk of each CMBS issue and determine the appropriate credit\nrating. Each CMBS is segregated into tranches. Losses due to default are first absorbed\nby the tranche with the lowest priority. Sometimes this most-junior tranche is not rated\nand is then referred to as the equity tranche, residual tranche, or first-loss tranche.\n"}
