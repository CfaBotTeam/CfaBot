{"id": "1536", "text": "Own-Price Elasticity of Demand\nOwn-price elasticity is a measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded to\na change in price. It is calculated as the ratio of the percentage change in quantity\ndemanded to a percentage change in price. When quantity demanded is very responsive\nto a change in price, we say demand is elastic; when quantity demanded is not very\nresponsive to a change in price, we say that demand is inelastic. In Figure 1, we\nillustrate the most extreme cases: perfectly elastic demand (at any higher price, quantity\ndemanded decreases to zero) and perfectly inelastic demand (a change in price has no\neffect on quantity demanded).\n"}
