{"id": 659, "text": "Technical analysis can be contrasted with fundamental analysis, which attempts to\ndetermine the intrinsic value of an asset. While fundamental analysis of a firm uses\nthe company's financial statements and other information to analyze its financial\nposition and determine its value, technical analysis uses only the firm's share price and\ntrading volume data to project a target price. Technical analysis is not concerned with\nidentifying buyers' and sellers' reasons for trading, but only with the trades that have\noccurred.\n"}
