{"id": "3863", "text": "Prepayment Provisions\nA partial or full repayment of principal in excess of the scheduled principal repayments\nrequired by the mortgage is referred to as a prepayment. If a homeowner sells her home\nduring the mortgage term (a common occurrence), repaying the remaining principal\nis required and is one type of prepayment. A homeowner who refinances her mortgage\nprepays the remaining principal amount using the proceeds of a new, lower interest rate\nloan. Some homeowners prepay by paying more than their scheduled payments in order\nto reduce the principal outstanding, reduce their interest charges, and eventually pay off\ntheir loans prior to maturity.\n"}
