{"id": 1710, "text": "CFO = cash flow from operations\nInt = interest expense\nFCInv = fixed capital investment (net capital expenditures)\nIt is not necessary to adjust for noncash charges and changes in working capital when\nstarting with CFO, since they are already reflected in the calculation of CFO. For firms\nthat follow IFRS, it is not necessary to adjust for interest expense that is included as a\npart of financing activities. Additionally, firms that follow IFRS can report dividends\npaid as operating activities. In this case, the dividends paid would be added back to\nCFO. Again, the goal is to calculate the cash flow that is available to the shareholders\nand debt holders. It is not necessary to adjust dividends for taxes since dividends paid\nare not tax deductible.\n"}
