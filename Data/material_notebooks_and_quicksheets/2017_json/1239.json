The unit of points is the last decimal place in\nthe spot rate quote. For a spot currency quote to four decimal places, such as 2.3481,\neach point is 0.0001 or 1/10,000th. A quote of +18.3 points for a 90-day forward\nexchange rate means that the forward rate is 0.00183 more than the spot exchange rate.\n"}
