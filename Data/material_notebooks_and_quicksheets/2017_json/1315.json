{"id": 1315, "text": "Because some costs are fixed in the short run, it will be better for the firm to continue\nproduction in the short run as long as average revenue is greater than average variable\ncosts. At prices between P, and P, in Figure 5, the firm has losses, but the loss is less\nthan the losses that would occur if all production were stopped. As long as total revenue\nis greater than total variable cost, at least some of the firm's fixed costs are covered\nby continuing to produce and sell its product. If the firm were to shut down, losses\nwould be equal to the fixed costs that still must be paid. As long as price is greater than\naverage variable costs, the firm will minimize its losses in the short run by continuing in\nbusiness.\n"}
