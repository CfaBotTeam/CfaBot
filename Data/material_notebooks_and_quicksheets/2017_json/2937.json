{"id": 2937, "text": "Professor's Note: The acceptlreject decision rule here is exactly equivalent to\nboth the NPV and IRR decision rules. That is, if PI > 1, then the NPV must\nbe positive, and the IRR must be greater than the discount rate. Note also that\nonce you have the NPV, you can just add back the initial outlay to get the PV of\nthe cash inflows used here. Recall that the NPV of Project B is $98.36 with an\ninitial cost of $2,000. PI is simply (2,000 + 98.36) / 2000.\n"}
