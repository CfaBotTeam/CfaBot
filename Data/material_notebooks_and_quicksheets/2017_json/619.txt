{"id": 619, "text": "Parametric tests rely on assumptions regarding the distribution of the population and\nare specific to population parameters. For example, the z-test relies upon a mean and a\nstandard deviation to define the normal distribution. The z-test also requires that either\nthe sample is large, relying on the central limit theorem to assure a normal sampling\ndistribution, or that the population is normally distributed.\n"}
