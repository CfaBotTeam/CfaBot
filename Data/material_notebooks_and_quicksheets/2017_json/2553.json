{"id": 2553, "text": "An index return may be calculated using a price index or a return index. A price index\nuses only the prices of the constituent securities in the return calculation. A rate of\nreturn that is calculated based on a price index is referred to as a price return.\nA return index includes both prices and income from the constituent securities. A rate\nof return that is calculated based on a return index is called a total return. If the assets\nin an index produce interim cash flows such as dividends or interest payments, the total\nreturn will be greater than the price return.\nOnce returns are calculated for each period, they then can be compounded together to\narrive at the return for the measurement period:\nRp = (1+Rs\u0131)(1+R$2)(1 + Rg3)(1+R$4)..(1+Rsk) \u2014 1\nwhere:\nRp = portfolio return during the measurement period\nk = total number of subperiods\nRsk = portfolio return during the subperiod k\n"}
