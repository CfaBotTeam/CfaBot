{"id": 1035, "text": "Consider a bank that has $1,000 in excess reserves (cash not needed for reserves) that it\nlends. Assume the required reserve ratio is 25%. If the borrower of the $1,000 deposits\nthe cash in a second bank, the second bank will be able to lend its excess reserves of\n$750 (0.75 X $1,000). Those funds may be deposited in a third bank, which can then\nlend its excess reserve of $563 (0.75 X $750). If this lending and depositing continues,\nthe money supply can expand to $4,000 [(1 / 0.25) x $1,000]. One dollar of excess\nreserves can generate a $4 increase in the money supply.\n"}
