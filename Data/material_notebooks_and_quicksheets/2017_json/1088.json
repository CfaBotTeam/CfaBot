{"id": "1088", "text": "In the United States, billions of dollars were made available for the Fed to buy assets\nother than short-term Treasury securities. Large amounts of mortgage securities were\npurchased from banks to encourage bank lending and to reduce mortgage rates in an\nattempt to revive the housing market, which had collapsed. When this program did not\nhave the desired effect, a second round of quantitative easing (QE2) was initiated. The\nFed purchased long-term Treasury bonds in large quantities (hundreds of billions of\ndollars) with the goal of bringing down longer-term interest rates and generating excess\nreserves to increase lending and economic growth. The Fed has also purchased securities\nwith credit risk as part of its quantitative easing, improving banks' balance sheets but\nperhaps just shifting risk from the private sector to the public sector.\n"}
