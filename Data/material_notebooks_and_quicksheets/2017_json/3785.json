{"id": 3785, "text": "The spot rate yield curve (spot curve) for U.S. Treasury bonds is also referred to as the\nzero curve (for zero-coupon) or strip curve (because zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds\nare also called stripped Treasuries). Recall that spot rates are the appropriate yields, and\ntherefore appropriate discount rates, for single payments to be made in the future.\nYields on zero-coupon government bonds are spot rates. Earlier in this topic review, we\ncalculated the value of a bond by discounting each separate payment by the spot rate\ncorresponding to the time until the payment will be received. Spot rates are usually\nquoted on a semiannual bond basis, so they are directly comparable to YTMs quoted for\ncoupon government bonds.\nA yield curve for coupon bonds shows the YTMs for coupon bonds at various\nmaturities. Yields are calculated for several maturities and yields for bonds with\nmaturities between these are estimated by linear interpolation. Figure 4 shows a yield\ncurve for coupon Treasury bonds constructed from yields on 1-month, 3-month,\n6-month, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, 10-year, 20 year, and 30-year maturities.\nYields are expressed on a semiannual bond basis.\n"}
