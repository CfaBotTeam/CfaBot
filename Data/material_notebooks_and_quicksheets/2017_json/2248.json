{"id": "2248", "text": "Consider this gamble: A coin will be flipped; if it comes up heads, you receive $100; if\nit comes up tails, you receive nothing. The expected payoff is 0.5($100) + 0.5($0) = $50. A\nrisk-averse investor would choose a payment of $50 (a certain outcome) over the gamble.\nA risk-seeking investor would prefer the gamble to a certain payment of $50. A riskneutral investor would be indifferent between the gamble and a certain payment of $50.\nIf expected returns are identical, a risk-averse investor will always choose the investment\nwith the least risk. However, an investor may select a very risky portfolio despite being\nrisk averse; a risk-averse investor will hold very risky assets if he feels that the extra\nreturn he expects to earn is adequate compensation for the additional risk.\n"}
