{"id": "1097", "text": "Disadvantages of fiscal policy tools:\nDirect taxes and transfer payments take time to implement, delaying the impact of\nfiscal policy.\nCapital spending also takes a long time to implement. The economy may have\nrecovered by the time its impact is felt.\nAnnouncing a change in fiscal policy may have significant effects on expectations. For\nexample, an announcement of future increase in taxes may immediately reduce current\nconsumption, rapidly producing the desired goal of reducing aggregate demand. Note\nthat not all fiscal policy tools affect economic activity equally. Spending tools are most\neffective in increasing aggregate demand. Tax reductions are somewhat less effective, as\npeople may not spend the entire amount of the tax savings. Tax reductions for those with\nlow incomes will be more effective in increasing aggregate demand, as those with lower\nincomes tend to spend a larger proportion of income on consumption; that is, they save\na smaller proportion of income and have a higher marginal propensity to consume.\n"}
