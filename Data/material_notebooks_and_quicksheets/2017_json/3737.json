{"id": "3737", "text": "So far we have used a bond's cash flows and an assumed yield-to-maturity in order to\ncalculate the value of the bond. Given a bond's price in the market, we can calculate its\nyield-to-maturity because it's a one-to-one relationship between the two. We can say that\nthe YTM is the discount rate that makes the present value of a bond's cash flows equal\nto its price. For a 5-year, annual pay 7% bond that is priced in the market at $1,020.78,\nthe YTM will satisfy the following equation:\n1 701 701 701 1,070\n== 1,020.78\n1+YTM\" (1+YTM)? * (1+YTM)3 *(1+YTM)+(1+YTM)\nWe can calculate the YTM (discount rate) that satisfies this equality as:\n"}
