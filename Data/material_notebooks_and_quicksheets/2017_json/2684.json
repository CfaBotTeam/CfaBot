{"id": 2684, "text": "The risk of equity securities is most commonly measured as the standard deviation of\nreturns. Preferred stock is less risky than common stock because preferred stock pays a\nknown, fixed dividend to investors that is a large part of the return, whereas common\ndividends are variable and can vary with earnings. Also, preferred stockholders receive\ntheir distributions before common shareholders and have a claim in liquidation equal to\nthe par value of their shares that has priority over the claims of common stock owners.\nBecause it is less risky, preferred stock has a lower average return than common stock.\nCumulative preferred shares have less risk than non-cumulative preferred shares because\nthey retain the right to receive any missed dividends before any common stock dividends\ncan be paid.\nFor both common and preferred shares, putable shares are less risky and callable shares\nare more risky compared to shares with neither option. Putable shares are less risky\nbecause if the market price drops, the investor can put the shares back to the firm at a\nfixed price (assuming the firm has the capital to honor the put). Because of this feature,\nputable shares usually pay a lower dividend yield than non-putable shares.\nCallable shares are the most risky because if the market price rises, the firm can call the\nshares, limiting the upside potential of the shares. Callable shares, therefore, usually have\nhigher dividend yields than non-callable shares.\n"}
