{"id": 2051, "text": "Long-lived Assets Held for Sale\nIf a firm reclassifies a long-lived asset from held for use to held for sale because\nmanagement intends to sell it, the asset is tested for impairment. At this point, the asset\nis no longer depreciated or amortized. The held-for-sale asset is impaired if its carrying\nvalue exceeds its net realizable value (fair value less selling costs). If impaired, the asset is\nwritten down to net realizable value and the loss is recognized in the income statement.\n"}
