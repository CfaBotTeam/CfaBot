{"id": 2410, "text": "1. An investor may have multiple managers actively managing to the same benchmark\nfor the same asset class (or may have significant benchmark overlap). In this case, one\nmanager may overweight an index stock while another may underweight the same\nstock. Taken together, there is no net active management risk, although each manager\nhas reported active management risk. Overall, the risk budget is underutilized as\nthere is less net active management than gross active management.\n2. When all managers are actively managing portfolios relative to an index, trading may\nbe excessive overall. This extra trading could have negative tax consequences, specifically potentially higher capital gains taxes, compared to an overall efficient tax strategy.\nOne way to address these issues is to use a core-satellite approach. The core-satellite\napproach invests the majority, or core, portion of the portfolio in passively managed\nindexes and invests a smaller, or satellite, portion in active strategies. This approach\nreduces the likelihood of excessive trading and offsetting active positions.\nClearly, the success of security selection will depend on the manager's skill and the\nopportunities (mispricings or inefficiencies) within a particular asset class. Similarly,\nthe success of tactical asset allocation will depend both on the existence of short-term\nopportunities in specific asset classes and on the manager's ability to identify them.\n"}
