{"id": "680", "text": "Continuation patterns suggest a pause in a trend rather than a reversal. Triangles form\nwhen prices reach lower highs and higher lows over a period of time (see Figure 7).\nTrendlines on the highs and on the lows thus converge when they are projected forward.\nTriangles can be symmetrical (higher lows and lower highs), ascending (higher lows and\na resistance level), or descending (lower highs and a support level).\n"}
