{"id": 1092, "text": "Keynesian economists believe that fiscal policy, through its effect on aggregate demand,\ncan have a strong effect on economic growth when the economy is operating at less than\nfull employment. Monetarists believe that the effect of fiscal stimulus is only temporary\nand that monetary policy should be used to increase or decrease inflationary pressures\nover time. Monetarists do not believe that monetary policy should be used in an attempt\nto influence aggregate demand to counter cyclical movements in the economy.\nDiscretionary fiscal policy refers to the spending and taxing decisions of a national\ngovernment that are intended to stabilize the economy. In contrast, automatic stabilizers\nare built-in fiscal devices triggered by the state of the economy. For example, during\na recession, tax receipts will fall, and government expenditures on unemployment\ninsurance payments will increase. Both of these tend to increase budget deficits and are\nexpansionary. Similarly, during boom times, higher tax revenues coupled with lower\noutflows for social programs tend to decrease budget deficits and are contractionary.\n"}
