{"id": 355, "text": "variance of X = np(1 - p)\nExample: Expected value of a binomial random variable\nBased on empirical data, the probability that the Dow Jones Industrial Average\n(DJIA) will increase on any given day has been determined to equal 0.67. Assuming\nthat the only other outcome is that it decreases, we can state p(UP) = 0.67 and\np(DOWN) = 0.33. Further, assume that movements in the DJIA are independent\n(i.e., an increase in one day is independent of what happened on another day).\n"}
