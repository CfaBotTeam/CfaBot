{"id": 2860, "text": "Free cash flow to equity (FCFE) can be used instead of dividends. FCFE is the cash\nremaining after a firm meets all of its debt obligations and provides for necessary capital\nexpenditures. FCFE reflects the firm's capacity for dividends and is useful for firms that\ncurrently do not pay a dividend. By using FCFE, an analyst does not need to project the\namount and timing of future dividends.\n"}
