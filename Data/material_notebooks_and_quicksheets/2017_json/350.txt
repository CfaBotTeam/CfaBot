{"id": 350, "text": "Example: Discrete uniform distribution\nDetermine p(6), F(6), and P(2 <X< 8) for the discrete uniform distribution\nfunction defined as:\nX = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, p(x) = 0.2\nAnswer:\np(6) = 0.2, since p(x) = 0.2 for all x. F(6) = P(X < 6) = np(x) = 3(0.2) = 0.6. Note\nthat n = 3 since 6 is the third outcome in the range of possible outcomes.\nP(2 < X < 8) = 4(0.2) = 0.8. Note that k = 4, since there are four outcomes in\nthe range 2 < X <8. The following figures illustrate the concepts of a probability\nfunction and cumulative distribution function for this distribution.\n"}
