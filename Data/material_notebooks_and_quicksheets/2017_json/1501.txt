{"id": 1501, "text": "Stagflation is an especially difficult situation for policy makers because actions to\nincrease aggregate demand to restore full employment will also increase the price level\neven more. Conversely, a decision by policy makers to fight inflation by decreasing\naggregate demand will decrease GDP even further. A decrease in wages and the prices of\nother productive inputs may be expected to increase SRAS and restore full-employment\nequilibrium. However, this process may be quite slow and doing nothing may be a very\nrisky strategy for a government when voters expect action to restore economic growth or\nstem inflationary pressures.\n"}
