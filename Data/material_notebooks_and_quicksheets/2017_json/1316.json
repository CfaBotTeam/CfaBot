{"id": 1316, "text": "If average revenue is less average variable cost, the firm's losses are greater than its fixed\ncosts, and it will minimize its losses by shutting down production in the short run. In\nthis case (a price less than P, in Figure 5), the loss from continuing to operate is greater\nthan the loss (total fixed costs) if the firm is shut down.\nIn the long run, all costs are variable, so a firm can avoid its (short-run) fixed costs by\nshutting down. For this reason, if price is expected to remain below minimum average\ntotal cost (Point A in Figure 5) in the long run, the firm will shut down rather than\ncontinue to generate losses.\n"}
