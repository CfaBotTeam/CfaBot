{"id": "486", "text": "Look-ahead bias occurs when a study tests a relationship using sample data that was not\navailable on the test date. For example, consider the test of a trading rule that is based\non the price-to-book ratio at the end of the fiscal year. Stock prices are available for all\ncompanies at the same point in time, while end-of-year book values may not be available\nuntil 30 to 60 days after the fiscal year ends. In order to account for this bias, a study\nthat uses price-to-book value ratios to test trading strategies might estimate the book\nvalue as reported at fiscal year end and the market value two months later.\nTime-period bias can result if the time period over which the data is gathered is\neither too short or too long. If the time period is too short, research results may reflect\nphenomena specific to that time period, or perhaps even data mining. If the time period\nis too long, the fundamental economic relationships that underlie the results may have\nchanged.\n"}
