{"id": 168, "text": "sample kurtosis =\nn 54\nwhere:\ns = sample standard deviation\nTo interpret kurtosis, note that it is measured relative to the kurtosis of a normal\ndistribution, which is 3. Positive values of excess kurtosis indicate a distribution that\nis leptokurtic (more peaked, fat tails), whereas negative values indicate a platykurtic\ndistribution (less peaked, thin tails). Excess kurtosis values that exceed 1.0 in absolute\nvalue are considered large. We can calculate kurtosis relative to that of a normal\ndistribution as:\nexcess kurtosis = sample kurtosis \u2013 3\nLOS 8.m: Compare the use of arithmetic and geometric means when analyzing\ninvestment returns.\nSince past annual returns are compounded each period, the geometric mean of past\nannual returns is the appropriate measure of past performance. It gives us the average\nannual compound return. With annual returns of 5%, 12%, and 9% over three years,\nthe geometric mean return of [(1.05)(1.12)(1.09)]1/3 - 1 = 8.63% tells us the single rate\nthat, if compounded over the three periods, would lead to the same increase in wealth as\nthe individual annual rates of return.\nThe arithmetic mean of (5% + 12% + 9%)/3 = 8.67% is, however, the statistically best\nestimator of the next year's returns given only the three years of return outcomes. To\nestimate multi-year returns (e.g. expected annual return over the next three years), the\ngeometric mean of 8.63% is the appropriate measure.\nConsider also a forward-looking model where returns will be either +100% or \u201350%\neach year for two years. Note that when returns are +100% in Year 1 and \u201350% in\nYear 2, the annual geometric mean return is [(1 + 100%)(1 - 50%)]1/2 - 1 = 0% and the\narithmetic mean annual return is (100% - 50%)/2 = 25%.\n"}
