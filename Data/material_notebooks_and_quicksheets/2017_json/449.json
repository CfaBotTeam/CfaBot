{"id": 449, "text": "The central limit theorem states that for simple random samples of size n from a\npopulation with a mean pu and a finite variance o?, the sampling distribution of the\nsample mean approaches a normal probability distribution with mean u and a\nvariance equal to \u00ba as the sample size becomes large.\nn\nThe central limit theorem is extremely useful because the normal distribution is\nrelatively easy to apply to hypothesis testing and to the construction of confidence\nintervals. Specific inferences about the population mean can be made from the sample\nmean, regardless of the population's distribution, as long as the sample size is \u201csufficiently\nlarge,\u201d which usually means n > 30.\n"}
