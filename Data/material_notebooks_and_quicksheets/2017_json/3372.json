{"id": 3372, "text": "There may also be benefits to holding the asset, either monetary or non-monetary.\nDividend payments on a stock or interest payments on a bond are examples of monetary\nbenefits of owning an asset. Non-monetary benefits of holding an asset are sometimes\nreferred to as its convenience yield. The convenience yield is difficult to measure and\nis only significant for some assets, primarily commodities. If an asset is difficult to sell\nshort in the market, owning it may convey benefits in circumstances where selling the\nasset is advantageous. For example, a shortage of the asset may drive prices up, making\nsale of the asset in the short term profitable. While the ability to look at a painting or\nsculpture provides non-monetary benefits to its owner, this is unlikely with corn or other\ncommodities.\n"}
