{"id": 2943, "text": "We can also see that the cash flows for Project B come later in the project's life. That's\nwhy the NPV of Project B falls faster than the NPV of Project A as the discount rate\nincreases, and the NPVs are eventually equal at a discount rate of 7.2%. At discount\nrates above 7.2%, the fact that the total cash flows of Project B are greater in nominal\ndollars is overridden by the fact that Project B\u2019s cash flows come later in the project\u2019s\nlife than those of Project A.\n"}
