{"id": 3703, "text": "MTNs can have fixed- or floating-rate coupons, but longer-maturity MTNs are typically\nfixed-rate bonds. Most MTNs, other than long-term MTNs, are issued by financial\ncorporations and most buyers are financial institutions. MTNs can be structured to meet\nan institution's specifications. While custom bond issues have less liquidity, they provide\nslightly higher yields compared to an issuer's publicly traded bonds.\n"}
