Event studies examine\nabnormal returns before and after the release of new information that affects a firm's\nintrinsic value, such as earnings announcements or dividend changes. The null\nhypothesis is that investors should not be able to earn positive abnormal returns on\naverage by trading based on firm events because prices will rapidly reflect news about a\nfirm's prospects. The evidence in developed markets indicates that markets are generally\nsemi-strong form efficient. However, there is evidence of semi-strong form inefficiency\nin some emerging markets.\n"}
