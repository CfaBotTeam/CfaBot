{"id": 1358, "text": "of demand curve D, and supply curve So, at price P, and quantity Qo. As indicated in\nPanel (b) of Figure 9, at the market price of P, each firm will produce 90. At this price\nand output, each firm earns a normal profit, and economic profit is zero. That is, MC\n= MR = P, and ATC is at its minimum. Now, suppose industry demand permanently\nincreases such that the industry demand curve in Panel (a) shifts to D. The new\nmarket price will be P, and industry output will increase to Qy. At the new price P1,\nexisting firms will produce q, and realize an economic profit because P > ATC. Positive\neconomic profits will cause new firms to enter the market. As these new firms increase\ntotal industry supply, the industry supply curve will gradually shift to Sy, and the market\nprice will decline back to Po. At the market price of Po, the industry will now produce\nQ2, with an increased number of firms in the industry, each producing at the original\nquantity, 9%. The individual firms will no longer enjoy an economic profit because ATC\n= P, at 90"}
