{"id": 3675, "text": "The most widely used reference rate for floating-rate bonds is the London Interbank\nOffer Rate (Libor), although other reference rates, such as Euribor, are also used. Libor\nrates are published daily for several currencies and for maturities of one day (overnight\nrates) to one year. Thus, there is no single \u201cLibor rate\u201d but rather a set of rates, such as\n\u201c30-day U.S. dollar Libor\u201d or \u201c90-day Swiss franc Libor.\u201d\n"}
