{"id": 3770, "text": "The current yield does not account for gains or losses as the bond's price moves toward\nits par value over time. A bond's simple yield takes a discount or premium into account\nby assuming that any discount or premium declines evenly over the remaining years\nto maturity. The sum of the annual coupon payment plus (minus) the straight-line\namortization of a discount (premium) is divided by the flat price to get the simple yield.\nFor a callable bond, an investor's yield will depend on whether and when the bond is\ncalled. The yield-to-call can be calculated for each possible call date and price. The\nlowest of yield-to-maturity and the various yields-to-call is termed the yield-to-worst.\nThe following example illustrates these calculations.\n"}
