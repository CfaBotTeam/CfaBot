{"id": "540", "text": "Type I and Type II Errors\nKeep in mind that hypothesis testing is used to make inferences about the parameters of\na given population on the basis of statistics computed for a sample that is drawn from\nthat population. We must be aware that there is some probability that the sample, in\nsome way, does not represent the population, and any conclusion based on the sample\nabout the population may be made in error.\nWhen drawing inferences from a hypothesis test, there are two types of errors:\n\u2022 Type I error: the rejection of the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n\u2022 Type II error: the failure to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.\nThe significance level is the probability of making a Type I error (rejecting the\nnull when it is true) and is designated by the Greek letter alpha (a). For instance, a\nsignificance level of 5% (a = 0.05) means there is a 5% chance of rejecting a true null\nhypothesis. When conducting hypothesis tests, a significance level must be specified in\norder to identify the critical values needed to evaluate the test statistic.\n"}
