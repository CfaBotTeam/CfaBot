{"id": "1999", "text": "Capitalizing an expenditure delays the recognition of an expense in the income\nstatement. Thus, in the period that an expenditure is capitalized, the firm will report\nhigher net income compared to immediately expensing. In subsequent periods, the firm\nwill report lower net income compared to expensing, as the capitalized expenditure is\nallocated to the income statement through depreciation expense. This allocation process\nreduces the variability of net income by spreading the expense over multiple periods.\n"}
