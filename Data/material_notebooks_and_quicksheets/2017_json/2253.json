{"id": 2253, "text": "Note that portfolio risk falls as the correlation between the assets' returns decreases. This\nis an important result of the analysis of portfolio risk: The lower the correlation of asset\nreturns, the greater the risk reduction (diversification) benefit of combining assets in a\nportfolio. If asset returns were perfectly negatively correlated, portfolio risk could be\neliminated altogether for a specific set of asset weights.\n"}
