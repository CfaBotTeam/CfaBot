{"id": "3700", "text": "Corporate Bonds\nIn the previous topic review, we discussed several features of corporate bonds. Corporate\nbonds are issued with various coupon structures and with both fixed-rate and floatingrate coupon payments. They may be secured by collateral or unsecured and may have\ncall, put, or conversion provisions.\nWe also discussed a sinking fund provision as a way to reduce the credit risk of a bond\nby redeeming part of the bond issue periodically over a bond's life. An alternative to a\nsinking fund provision is to issue a serial bond issue. With a serial bond issue, bonds are\nissued with several maturity dates so that a portion of the issue is redeemed periodically.\nAn important difference between a serial bond issue and an issue with a sinking fund\nis that with a serial bond issue, investors know at issuance when specific bonds will be\nredeemed. A bond issue that does not have a serial maturity structure is said to have a\nterm maturity structure with all the bonds maturing on the same date.\n"}
