{"id": 1979, "text": "Business activities can be classified as operating, investing, or financing activities.\nOperating activities are those undertaken in a firm's ordinary course of business, such\nas producing and selling goods and services. Investing activities refer to buying or\nselling long-term assets, such as machinery or land. Financing activities refer to issuing\ndebt (borrowing money), redeeming debt (repaying money), issuing common stock,\nrepurchasing common stock, or paying cash dividends.\nHow an activity is classified depends on the nature of the firm. For example, receiving\ninterest payments on debt is likely to be classified as an investing activity by a\nmanufacturing firm, but likely to be classified as an operating activity by a financial\nservices firm.\n"}
