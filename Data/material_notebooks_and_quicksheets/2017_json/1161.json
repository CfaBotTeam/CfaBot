{"id": 1161, "text": "The benefits of trade are not hard to understand. As an example, consider China, and\nreally Asia as a whole, which has had rapidly growing exports to the United States and\nother countries. The benefit to the importing countries has been lower-cost goods, from\ntextiles to electronics. The benefits to the Chinese economy have been in increasing\nemployment, increasing wages for workers, and the profits from its export products.\nThe costs of trade are primarily borne by those in domestic industries that compete\nwith imported goods. Textile workers who have lost their jobs in the United States,\nas more and more textiles are imported, are certainly worse off in the short run. As\nother industries, such as health care, have grown, these workers have had to retrain to\nqualify for the new jobs in those fields. At the same time, U.S. firms that produce textile\nproducts using capital and technology intensive production methods have expanded. We\naddress the reasons for this and the underlying economic theory in this topic review.\n"}
