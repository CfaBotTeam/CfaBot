{"id": 988, "text": "Three factors cause a Laspeyres index of consumer prices to be biased upward as a\nmeasure of the cost of living:\nNew goods. Older products are often replaced by newer, but initially more expensive,\nproducts. New goods are periodically added to the market basket, and the older\ngoods they replace are reduced in weight in the index. This biases the index upward.\nQuality changes. If the price of a product increases because the product has\nimproved, the price increase is not due to inflation but still increases the price index.\nSubstitution. Even in an inflation-free economy, prices of goods relative to each\nother change all the time. When two goods are substitutes for each other, consumers\nincrease their purchases of the relatively cheaper good and buy less of the relatively\nmore expensive good. Over time, such changes can make a Laspeyres index's fixed\nbasket of goods a less accurate measure of typical household spending.\nA technique known as hedonic pricing can be used to adjust a price index for product\nquality. To address the bias from substitution, reporting agencies can use a chained or\nchain-weighted price index such as a Fisher index. A Fisher index is the geometric mean\nof a Laspeyres index and a Paasche index. A Paasche index uses the current consumption\nweights, prices from the base period, and prices in the current period.\n"}
