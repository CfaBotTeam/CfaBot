A The price-yield relationship is inverse. If the required yield decreases, the bond's price\nwill increase, and vice versa.\n4. A With 20 years to maturity, the value of the bond with an annual-pay yield of 6.5%\nis N = 20, PMT = 50, FV = 1,000, I/Y = 6.5, CPT + PV = -834.72. With N = 17,\nCPT + PV = -848.34, so the value will increase $13.62.\n5. A A spot rate is a discount rate for a single future payment. Simple yield is a measure of a\nbond's yield that accounts for coupon interest and assumes straight-line amortization of\na discount or premium. A forward rate is an interest rate for a future period, such as a\n3-month rate six months from today.\n6. A bond value =\n4,000 4,000 104,000\n= $101,419.28\n1.032' (1.034)2(1.035)3\n7.
