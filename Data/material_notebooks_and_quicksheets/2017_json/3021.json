{"id": 3021, "text": "Correct Treatment of Flotation Costs\nIn the incorrect treatment we have just seen, flotation costs effectively increase the\nWACC by a fixed percentage and will be a factor for the duration of the project because\nfuture project cash flows are discounted at this higher WACC to determine project NPV.\nThe problem with this approach is that flotation costs are not an ongoing expense for\nthe firm. Flotation costs are a cash outflow that occurs at the initiation of a project and\naffect the project NPV by increasing the initial cash outflow. Therefore, the correct way\nto account for flotation costs is to adjust the initial project cost. An analyst should calculate\nthe dollar amount of the flotation cost attributable to the project and increase the initial\ncash outflow for the project by this amount.\nExample: Correctly accounting for flotation costs\nOmni Corporation is considering a project that requires a $400,000 cash outlay and\nis expected to produce cash flows of $150,000 per year for the next four years. Omni's\ntax rate is 35%, and the before-tax cost of debt is 6.5%. The current share price for\nOmni's stock is $36 per share, and the expected dividend next year is $2 per share.\nOmni's expected growth rate is 5%. Assume that Omni finances the project with\n50% debt and 50% equity capital and that flotation costs for equity are 4.5%. The\nappropriate discount rate for the project is the WACC.\n"}
