This problem is reduced by using an\nalternative measure of market concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI).\nThe HHI is calculated as the sum of the squares of the market shares of the largest\nfirms in the market. The following example illustrates this difference between the two\nmeasures and their calculation.\n"}
