{"id": "440", "text": "Simple random sampling is a method of selecting a sample in such a way that each item\nor person in the population being studied has the same likelihood of being included in\nthe sample. As an example of simple random sampling, assume that you want to draw a\nsample of five items out of a group of 50 items. This can be accomplished by numbering\neach of the 50 items, placing them in a hat, and shaking the hat. Next, one number\ncan be drawn randomly from the hat. Repeating this process (experiment) four more\ntimes results in a set of five numbers. The five drawn numbers (items) comprise a simple\nrandom sample from the population. In applications like this one, a random-number\ntable or a computer random-number generator is often used to create the sample.\nAnother way to form an approximately random sample is systematic sampling, selecting\nevery nth member from a population.\n"}
