{"id": "2821", "text": "Professor's Note: Many finance textbooks solve multiple stage growth problems\nlike this one by using the first dividend that has grown at the constant long-term\nrate to calculate the terminal value, one period after the dividend we have used.\nExcept for rounding, this results in the same current stock value. In fact, the\nconstant growth model can be employed using any dividend during the assumed\nconstant growth period.\n"}
