{"id": "396", "text": "One property of continuously compounded rates of return is that they are additive\nfor multiple periods. Note that the (effective) holding period return over two years is\ncalculated by doubling the continuously compounded annual rate. If Rec = 10%, the\n(effective) holding period return over two years is e (0.10)2 -1 = 22.14%. In general, the\nholding period return after T years, when the annual continuously compounded rate is\nRe, is given by:\nHPRT = eRecXT -1\n"}
