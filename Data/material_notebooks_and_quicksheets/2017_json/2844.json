{"id": 2844, "text": "For a number of good reasons, capital budgeting may be the most important\nresponsibility that a financial manager has. First, because a capital budgeting decision\noften involves the purchase of costly long-term assets with lives of many years, the\ndecisions made may determine the future success of the firm. Second, the principles\nunderlying the capital budgeting process also apply to other corporate decisions, such\nas working capital management and making strategic mergers and acquisitions. Finally,\nmaking good capital budgeting decisions is consistent with management's primary goal\nof maximizing shareholder value.\nThe capital budgeting process has four administrative steps:\nStep 1: Idea generation. The most important step in the capital budgeting process\nis generating good project ideas. Ideas can come from a number of sources\nincluding senior management, functional divisions, employees, or sources\noutside the company.\nStep 2: Analyzing project proposals. Because the decision to accept or reject a capital\nproject is based on the project's expected future cash flows, a cash flow forecast\nmust be made for each product to determine its expected profitability.\n"}
