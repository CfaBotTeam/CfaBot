{"id": 1045, "text": "A central bank can affect short-term interest rates by increasing or decreasing the money\nsupply. An increase in the money supply (shift of the money supply curve to the right)\nwill put downward pressure on interest rates, as illustrated in Figure 2. With an increase\nin the money supply, there is excess supply of money at the previous rate of 5%. To\nreduce their money holdings, firms and households buy securities, increasing securities\nprices and decreasing the interest rate until the new equilibrium interest rate of 4% is\nachieved. If the central bank decreases the money supply, excess demand for money\nbalances results in sales of securities and an increase in the interest rate.\n"}
