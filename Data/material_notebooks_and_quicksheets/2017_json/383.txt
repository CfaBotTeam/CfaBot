{"id": 383, "text": "Roy's safety-first criterion states that the optimal portfolio minimizes the probability\nthat the return of the portfolio falls below some minimum acceptable level. This\nminimum acceptable level is called the threshold level. Symbolically, Roy's safety-first\ncriterion can be stated as:\nminimize P(R, <R!)\nwhere:\nR, = portfolio return\nR = threshold level return\nIf portfolio returns are normally distributed, then Roy's safety-first criterion can be\nstated as:\n"}
