{"id": "3180", "text": "portfolio duration = w, D, + W, D, + ... + WN PN\nwhere:\nW; = full price of bond i divided by the total value of the portfolio\nD = the duration of bond i\nN = the number of bonds in the portfolio\nOne limitation of this approach is that for portfolio duration to \u201cmake sense\u201d the\nYTM of every bond in the portfolio must change by the same amount. Only with this\nassumption of a parallel shift in the yield curve is portfolio duration calculated with this\napproach consistent with the idea of the percentage change in portfolio value per 1%\nchange in YTM.\nWe can think of the second approach as a practical approximation of the theoretically\ncorrect duration that the first approach describes. This approximation is less accurate\nwhen there is greater variation in yields among portfolio bonds, but is the same as the\nportfolio duration under the first approach when the yield curve is flat.\n"}
