It would be nice if you could\ncalculate all these ratios, but it is imperative that you understand what firm characteristic\neach one is measuring, and even more important, that you know whether a higher or\nlower ratio is better in each instance. Different analysts calculate some ratios differently.\nIt would be helpful if analysts were always careful to distinguish between total liabilities,\ntotal interest-bearing debt, long-term debt, and creditor and trade debt, but they do not.\nSome analysts routinely add deferred tax liabilities to debt or exclude goodwill when\ncalculating assets and equity; others do not. Statistical reporting services almost always\ndisclose how each of the ratios they present was calculated. So do not get too tied up\nin the details of each ratio, but understand what each one represents and what factors\nwould likely lead to significant changes in a particular ratio. The DuPont formulas have\nbeen with us a long time and were in the curriculum when I took the exams back in the\n1980s. Decomposing ROE into its components is an important analytic technique and\nit should definitely be in your tool box.\n"}
