{"id": 585, "text": "n2\nand where:\nsi = variance of the first sample\ns = variance of the second sample\nn = number of observations in the first sample\nng = number of observations in the second sample\nWith no assumption of equal variances, the denominator (standard error) is based on\nthe individual sample variances for each sample.\nYou do not need to memorize these formulas, but should understand the numerator,\nthe fact that these are t-statistics, and that the variance of the pooled sample is\nused when the sample variances are assumed to be equal. The intuition here is\nstraightforward. If the sample means are very close together, the numerator of the\nt-statistic (and the t-statistic itself) are small, and we do not reject equality. If the\nsample means are far apart, the numerator of the t-statistic (and the t-statistic itself)\nare large, and we reject equality. Perhaps not as easy to remember is the fact that this\ntest is only valid for two populations that are independent and normally distributed.\nExample: Difference between means - equal variances\nSue Smith is investigating whether the abnormal returns for acquiring firms during\nmerger announcement periods differ for horizontal and vertical mergers. She estimates\nthe abnormal returns for a sample of acquiring firms associated with horizontal\nmergers and a sample of acquiring firms involved in vertical mergers. Her sample\nfindings are reported in the following figure.\nAbnormal Returns During Merger Announcement Periods\n"}
