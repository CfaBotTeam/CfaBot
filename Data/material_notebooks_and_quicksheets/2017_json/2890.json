{"id": 2890, "text": "2. Cash flows are based on opportunity costs. Opportunity costs are cash flows that a\nfirm will lose by undertaking the project under analysis. These are cash flows\ngenerated by an asset the firm already owns that would be forgone if the project\nunder consideration is undertaken. Opportunity costs should be included in project\ncosts. For example, when building a plant, even if the firm already owns the land,\nthe cost of the land should be charged to the project because it could be sold if not\nused.\n3. The timing of cash flows is important. Capital budgeting decisions account for the\ntime value of money, which means that cash flows received earlier are worth more\nthan cash flows to be received later.\n4. Cash flows are analyzed on an after-tax basis. The impact of taxes must be considered\nwhen analyzing all capital budgeting projects. Firm value is based on cash flows they\nget to keep, not those they send to the government.\nFinancing costs are reflected in the project's required rate of return. Do not consider\nfinancing costs specific to the project when estimating incremental cash flows. The\ndiscount rate used in the capital budgeting analysis takes account of the firm's cost\nof capital. Only projects that are expected to return more than the cost of the capital\nneeded to fund them will increase the value of the firm.\n"}
