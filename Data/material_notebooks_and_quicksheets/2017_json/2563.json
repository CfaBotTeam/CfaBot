{"id": 2563, "text": "The Value Line Composite Average and the Financial Times Ordinary Share Index are\nwell-known examples of equal-weighted indexes.\nA market capitalization-weighted index (or value-weighted index) has weights based\non the market capitalization of each index stock (current stock price multiplied by the\nnumber of shares outstanding) as a proportion of the total market capitalization of all\nthe stocks in the index. A market capitalization-weighted index return can be matched\nwith a portfolio in which the value of each security position in the portfolio is the\nsame proportion of the total portfolio value as the proportion of that security's market\ncapitalization to the total market capitalization of all of the securities included in the\nindex. This weighting method more closely represents changes in aggregate investor\nwealth than price weighting. Because the weight of an index stock is based on its market\ncapitalization, a market capitalization-weighted index does not need to be adjusted when\na stock splits or pays a stock dividend.\n"}
