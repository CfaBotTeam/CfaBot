{"id": 3009, "text": "The general risk of the developing country is reflected in its sovereign yield spread.\nThis is the difference in yields between the developing country's government bonds\n(denominated in the developed market's currency) and Treasury bonds of a similar\nmaturity. To estimate an equity risk premium for the country, adjust the sovereign yield\nspread by the ratio of volatility between the country's equity market and its government\nbond market (for bonds denominated in the developed market's currency). A more\nvolatile equity market increases the country risk premium, other things equal.\n"}
