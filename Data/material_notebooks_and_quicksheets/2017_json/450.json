{"id": 450, "text": "Important properties of the central limit theorem include the following:\nIf the sample size n is sufficiently large (n > 30), the sampling distribution\nof the sample means will be approximately normal. Remember what's going\non here, random samples of size n are repeatedly being taken from an overall\nlarger population. Each of these random samples has its own mean, which is\nitself a random variable, and this set of sample means has a distribution that is\napproximately normal.\nThe mean of the population, pl, and the mean of the distribution of all possible\nsample means are equal.\nThe variance of the distribution of sample means is \u201c, the population variance\ndivided by the sample size.\n"}
