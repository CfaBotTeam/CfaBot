{"id": 3553, "text": "Potential Benefits and Risks of Real Estate\nReal estate performance is measured by three different types of indices. An appraisal\nindex, such as those prepared by the National Council of Real Estate Investment\nFiduciaries (NCREIF), is based on periodic estimates of property values. Appraisal\nindex returns are smoother than those based on actual sales and have the lowest standard\ndeviation of returns of the various index methods. A repeat sales index is based on price\nchanges for properties that have sold multiple times. The sample of properties sold and\nthus included in the index is not necessarily random and may not be representative of\nthe broad spectrum of properties available (an example of sample selection bias). REIT\nindices are based on the actual trading prices of REIT shares, similar to equity indices.\n"}
