{"id": "3874", "text": "Prepayments cause the timing and amount of cash flows from mortgage loans and\nMBS to be uncertain; rapid prepayment reduces the amount of principal outstanding\non the loans supporting the MBS so the total interest paid over the life of the MBS is\nreduced. Because of this, it is necessary to make specific assumptions about prepayment\nrates in order to value mortgage pass-through securities. The single monthly mortality\nrate (SMM) is the percentage by which prepayments reduce the month-end principal\nbalance, compared to what it would have been with only scheduled principal payments\n(with no prepayments). The conditional prepayment rate (CPR) is an annualized\nmeasure of prepayments. Prepayment rates depend on the weighted average coupon rate\nof the loan pool, current interest rates, and prior prepayments of principal.\nThe Public Securities Association (PSA) prepayment benchmark assumes that the monthly\nprepayment rate for a mortgage pool increases as it ages (becomes seasoned). The PSA\nbenchmark is expressed as a monthly series of CPRs. If the prepayment rate (CPR) of an\nMBS is expected to be the same as the PSA standard benchmark CPR, we say the PSA\nis 100 (100% of the benchmark CPR). A pool of mortgages may have prepayment rates\nthat are faster or slower than PSA 100, depending on the current level of interest rates\nand the coupon rate of the issue. A PSA of 50 means that prepayments are 50% of the\n"}
