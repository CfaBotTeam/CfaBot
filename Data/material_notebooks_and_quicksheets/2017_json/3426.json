{"id": 3426, "text": "Our derivation of put-call parity for European options is based on the payoffs of two\nportfolio combinations, a fiduciary call and a protective put.\nA fiduciary call is a combination of a call with exercise price X and a pure-discount,\nriskless bond that pays X at maturity (option expiration). The payoff for a fiduciary call\nat expiration is X when the call is out of the money, and X + (S \u2013 X) = S when the call is\nin the money.\n"}
