{"id": 1657, "text": "With a few exceptions, operating activities relate to the firm's current assets and current\nliabilities. Investing activities typically relate to the firm's noncurrent assets, and\nfinancing activities typically relate to the firm's noncurrent liabilities and equity.\nTransactions for which the timing of revenue or expense recognition differs from the\nreceipt or payment of cash are reflected in changes in balance sheet accounts. For\nexample, when revenues (sales) exceed cash collections, the firm has sold items on credit\nand accounts receivable (an asset) increase. The opposite occurs when customers repay\nmore on their outstanding accounts than the firm extends in new credit: cash collections\nexceed revenues and accounts receivable decrease. When purchases from suppliers exceed\ncash payments, accounts payable (a liability) increase. When cash payments exceed\npurchases, payables decrease.\n"}
