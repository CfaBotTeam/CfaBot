{"id": "3366", "text": "Pure-discount bonds and other bonds sold at significant discounts to par when issued\nare termed original issue discount (OID) bonds. Because the gains over an OID bond's\ntenor as the price moves towards par value are really interest income, these bonds can\ngenerate a tax liability even when no cash interest payment has been made. In many\ntax jurisdictions, a portion of the discount from par at issuance is treated as taxable\ninterest income each year. This tax treatment also allows that the tax basis of the OID\nbonds is increased each year by the amount of interest income recognized, so there is no\nadditional capital gains tax liability at maturity.\n"}
