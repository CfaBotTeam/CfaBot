{"id": 2496, "text": "To avoid price execution uncertainty, a trader can place a limit order instead of the\nmarket order. The disadvantage of the limit order is that it might not be filled. For\nexample, if a trader places a limit buy order of $50 and no one is willing to sell at $50,\nthe order will not be filled. Furthermore, if the stock price rises over time, the trader\nmisses out on the gains.\n"}
