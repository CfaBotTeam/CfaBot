{"id": 3216, "text": "LOS 55.f\nThere are two methods for calculating portfolio duration:\n\u2022 Calculate the weighted average number of periods until cash flows will be received\nusing the portfolio\u2019s IRR (its cash flow yield). This method is better theoretically but\ncannot be used for bonds with options.\nCalculate the weighted average of durations of bonds in the portfolio (the method\nmost often used). Portfolio duration is the percentage change in portfolio value for a\n1% change in yield, only for parallel shifts of the yield curve.\n"}
