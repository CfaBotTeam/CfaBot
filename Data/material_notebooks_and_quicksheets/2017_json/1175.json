{"id": 1175, "text": "The entire shaded area in Figure 5 represents the loss of consumer surplus in the\ndomestic economy. The portion with vertical lines, the area to the left of the domestic\nsupply curve between P protection and Pworld, represents the gain in the producer surplus\nof domestic producers. The portion with horizontal lines, the area bounded by QD,-\nQS, and P protection - Pworld, represents the gain to the domestic government from tariff\nrevenue. The two remaining triangular areas are the deadweight loss from the restriction\non free trade.\nIn the case of a quota, if the domestic government collects the full value of the import\nlicenses, the result is the same as for a tariff. If the domestic government does not charge\nfor the import licenses, this amount is a gain to those foreign exporters who receive the\nimport licenses under the quota and are termed quota rents.\n"}
