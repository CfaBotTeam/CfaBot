{"id": "2264", "text": "Indifference curves slope upward for risk-averse investors because they will only take on\nmore risk (standard deviation of returns) if they are compensated with greater expected\nreturns. An investor who is relatively more risk averse requires a relatively greater\nincrease in expected return to compensate for a given increase in risk. In other words,\na more risk-averse investor will have steeper indifference curves, reflecting a higher risk\naversion coefficient.\n"}
