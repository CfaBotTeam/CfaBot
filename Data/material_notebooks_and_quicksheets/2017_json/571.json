{"id": "571", "text": "The population variance for our sample of returns is unknown. Hence, the\nt-distribution is appropriate. With 250 observations, however, the sample is\nconsidered to be large, so the z-distribution would also be acceptable. This is a trick\nquestion\u2014either distribution, t or z, is appropriate. With regard to the difference\nin the likelihood of rejecting a true null, since our sample is so large, the critical\nvalues for the t and z are almost identical. Hence, there is almost no difference in the\nlikelihood of rejecting a true null.\n"}
