{"id": "259", "text": "Properties of correlation of two random variables R, and R are summarized here:\nCorrelation measures the strength of the linear relationship between two random\nvariables.\nCorrelation has no units.\nThe correlation ranges from \u20131 to +1. That is, -1< Corr(R,, R)< +1.\nIf Corr(R,, R) = 1.0, the random variables have perfect positive correlation. This\nmeans that a 'movement in one random variable results in a proportional positive\nmovement in the other relative to its mean.\nIf Corr(R, R) = -1.0, the random variables have perfect negative correlation.\nThis means that a movement in one random variable results in an exact opposite\nproportional movement in the other relative to its mean.\nIf Corr(R,, R) = 0, there is no linear relationship between the variables, indicating\nthat prediction of R, cannot be made on the basis of R, using linear methods.\nExample: Correlation\nUsing our previous example, compute and interpret the correlation of the returns for\nstocks A and B, given that o2(R) = 0.0028 and o?(R= 0.0124 and recalling that\nCov(R,R) = 0.0058.\nAnswer:\nFirst, it is necessary to convert the variances to standard deviations.\n"}
