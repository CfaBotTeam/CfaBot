{"id": "1067", "text": "The monetary transmission mechanism refers to the ways in which a change in\nmonetary policy, specifically the central bank's policy rate, affects the price level and\ninflation. There are four channels through which a change in the policy rates the\nmonetary authorities control directly are transmitted to prices. They are transmitted\nthrough their effect on other short-term rates, asset values, currency exchange rates, and\nexpectations. We can examine the transmission mechanism in more detail by considering\nthe effects of a change to a contractionary monetary policy implemented through an\nincrease in the policy rate.\nBanks short-term lending rates will increase in line with the increase in the policy\nrate. The higher rates will decrease aggregate demand as consumers reduce credit\npurchases and businesses cut back on investment in new projects.\nBond prices, equity prices, and asset prices in general will decrease as the discount\nrates applied to future expected cash flows are increased. This may have a wealth\neffect because a decrease in the value of households' assets may increase the savings\nrate and decrease consumption.\nBoth consumers and businesses may decrease their expenditures because their\nexpectations for future economic growth decrease.\nThe increase in interest rates may attract foreign investment in debt securities,\nleading to an appreciation of the domestic currency relative to foreign currencies. An\nappreciation of the domestic currency increases the foreign currency prices of\nexports and can reduce demand for the country's export goods.\nTaken together, these effects act to decrease aggregate demand and put downward\npressure on the price level. A decrease in the policy rate would affect the price level\nthrough the same channels, but in the opposite direction.\n"}
