{"id": 3778, "text": "Yields for Money Market Instruments\nRecall that yields on money market securities can be stated as a discount from face value\nor as add-on yields, and can be based on a 360-day or 365-day basis. U.S. Treasury bills\nare quoted as annualized discounts from face value based on a 360-day year. Libor and\nbank CD rates are quoted as add-on yields. We need to be able to:\nCalculate the actual payment on a money market security given its yield and\nknowledge of how the yield was calculated.\n\u2022 Compare the yields on two securities that are quoted on different yield bases.\nBoth discount basis and add-on yields in the money market are quoted as simple\nannual interest. The following example illustrates the required calculations and quote\nconventions.\n"}
