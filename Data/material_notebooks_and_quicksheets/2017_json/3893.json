{"id": 3893, "text": "Figure 5 illustrates that the PAC I tranche has less prepayment risk than the support\ntranche because the variability of its average life is significantly lower.\nWhen prepayment speeds fall and prepayments decrease, the support tranche average\nlife is significantly longer than the average life of the PAC I tranche. Thus, the\nsupport tranche has significantly more extension risk.\nWhen prepayment speeds rise and prepayments increase, the support tranche average\nlife is much shorter than that of the PAC I tranche. Thus, the support tranche also\nhas significantly more contraction risk.\nWithin the initial PAC collar of 100 to 300 PSA, the average life of the PAC I\ntranche is constant at 6.5 years.\n"}
