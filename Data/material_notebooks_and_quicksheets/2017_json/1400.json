{"id": "1400", "text": "The important thing to note here is that when compared to a perfectly competitive\nindustry, the monopoly firm will produce less total output and charge a higher price.\nRecall from our review of perfect competition that the efficient quantity is the one for\nwhich the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is maximized. In Figure 21,\nthis quantity is where S = D, or equivalently, where marginal cost (MC) = marginal\nbenefit (MB). Monopoly creates a deadweight loss relative to perfect competition because\nmonopolies produce a quantity that does not maximize the sum of consumer surplus and\nproducer surplus. A further loss of efficiency results from rent seeking when producers\nspend time and resources to try to acquire or establish a monopoly.\n"}
