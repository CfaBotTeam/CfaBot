{"id": "2576", "text": "Rebalancing refers to adjusting the weights of securities in a portfolio to their target\nweights after price changes have affected the weights. For index calculations, rebalancing\nto target weights on the index securities is done on a periodic basis, usually quarterly.\nBecause the weights in price- and value-weighted indexes (portfolios) are adjusted to\ntheir correct values by changes in prices, rebalancing is an issue primarily for equalweighted indexes. As noted previously, the weights on security returns in an (initially)\nequal-weighted portfolio are not equal as securities prices change over time. Therefore,\nrebalancing the portfolio at the end of each period used to calculate index returns is\nnecessary for the portfolio return to match the index return.\nIndex reconstitution refers to periodically adding and deleting securities that make\nup an index. Securities are deleted if they no longer meet the index criteria and are\nreplaced by other securities that do. Indexes are reconstituted to reflect corporate events\nsuch as bankruptcy or delisting of index firms and are at the subjective judgment of a\ncommittee.\n"}
