{"id": "1096", "text": "Indirect taxes are levied on goods and services. These include sales taxes, value-added\ntaxes (VATs), and excise taxes. Indirect taxes can be used to reduce consumption of some\ngoods and services (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, gambling).\nDesirable attributes of tax policy:\nSimplicity to use and enforce.\nEfficiency; having the least interference with market forces and not acting as a\ndeterrent to working.\nFairness is quite subjective, but two commonly held beliefs are:\n\u2022 Horizontal equality: people in similar situations should pay similar taxes.\n\u2022 Vertical equality: richer people should pay more in taxes.\nSufficiency, in that taxes should generate sufficient revenues to meet the spending\nneeds of the government.\nAdvantages of fiscal policy tools:\nSocial policies, such as discouraging tobacco use, can be implemented very quickly\nvia indirect taxes.\nQuick implementation of indirect taxes also means that government revenues can be\nincreased without significant additional costs.\n"}
