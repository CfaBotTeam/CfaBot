{"id": 2109, "text": "Inventory Management\nInventory management involves a trade-off as well. Inventory levels that are too low will\nresult in lost sales due to stock-outs, while inventory that is too large will have carrying\ncosts because the firm's capital is tied up in inventory. Reducing inventory will free up\ncash that can be invested in interest-bearing securities or used to reduce debt or equity\nfunding. Increasing average days' inventory or a decreasing inventory turnover ratio can\nboth indicate that inventory is too large. A large inventory can lead to greater losses\nfrom obsolete items and can also indicate that obsolete items that no longer sell well are\nincluded in inventory.\nComparing average days of inventory and inventory turnover ratios between industries,\nor even between two firms that have different business strategies, can be misleading. The\ngrocery business typically has high inventory turnover, while an art gallery's inventory\nturnover will typically be low. An auto parts firm that stocks hard-to-find parts for\nantique cars will likely have a low inventory turnover (and charge premium prices)\ncompared to a chain auto parts store that does most of its business in standard items\nlike oil filters, brake parts, and antifreeze. In any business, inventory management is an\nimportant component of effective overall financial management.\n"}
