{"id": "1499", "text": "Changes in wages or the prices of other important productive inputs can shift the\nSRAS curve, affecting real GDP and the price level in the short run. An important case\nto consider is a decrease in SRAS caused by an increase in the prices of raw materials\nor energy. As illustrated in Figure 13, the new short-run equilibrium is at lower GDP\nand a higher overall price level for goods and services compared to the initial long-run\nequilibrium. This combination of declining economic output and higher prices is termed\nstagflation (stagnant economy with inflation).\n"}
