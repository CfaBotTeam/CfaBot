Subcategories are:\nMerger arbitrage: Buy the shares of a firm being acquired and sell short the firm\nmaking the acquisition.\nDistressed/restructuring: Buy the (undervalued) securities of firms in\nfinancial distress when analysis indicates value will be increased by a successful\nrestructuring; possibly short overvalued security types at the same time.\nActivist shareholder: Buy sufficient equity shares to influence a company's\npolicies with the goal of increasing company value.\nSpecial situations: Invest in the securities of firms that are issuing or\nrepurchasing securities, spinning off divisions, selling assets, or distributing\ncapital.\n"}
