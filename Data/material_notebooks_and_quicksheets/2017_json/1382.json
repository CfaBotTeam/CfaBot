{"id": "1382", "text": "An example of such a two-firm oligopoly game is illustrated in Figure 16. Each firm\nmay charge either a high price or a low price, and the profits to each firm are as shown.\nAssume the firms have agreed to both charge a high price. The Nash equilibrium is for\nFirm A and Firm B to charge a low price. This is the only combination from which\nneither firm can unilaterally change its action to improve its profits. Total profits are\ngreater if both honor the agreement, but either Firm A or Firm B can improve profits\nfrom 150 to 200 by cheating on the agreement. However, the non-cheating firm can\nthen increase profits from 50 to 100 by cheating:\n"}
