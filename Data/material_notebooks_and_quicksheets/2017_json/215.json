{"id": "215", "text": "Unconditional probability (a.k.a. marginal probability) refers to the probability of an\nevent regardless of the past or future occurrence of other events. If we are concerned\nwith the probability of an economic recession, regardless of the occurrence of\nchanges in interest rates or inflation, we are concerned with the unconditional\nprobability of a recession.\nA conditional probability is one where the occurrence of one event affects the\nprobability of the occurrence of another event. For example, we might be concerned\nwith the probability of a recession given that the monetary authority increases\ninterest rates. This is a conditional probability. The key word to watch for here is\n\"given.\u201d Using probability notation, \u201cthe probability of a given the occurrence of B\u201d\nis expressed as P(A|B), where the vertical bar (1) indicates \u201cgiven,\u201d or \u201cconditional\nupon.\" For our interest rate example above, the probability of a recession given\nan increase in interest rates is expressed as P(recession | increase in interest rates). A\nconditional probability of an occurrence is also called its likelihood.\nLOS 9.e: Explain the multiplication, addition, and total probability rules.\n"}
