{"id": 3873, "text": "An important characteristic of pass-through securities is their prepayment risk. Because\nthe mortgage loans used as collateral for agency MBS have no prepayment penalty, the\nMBS themselves have significant prepayment risk. Recall that prepayments are principal\nrepayments in excess of the scheduled principal repayments for amortizing loans. The\nrisk that prepayments will be slower than expected is called extension risk and the risk\nthat prepayments will be more rapid than expected is called contraction risk.\n"}
