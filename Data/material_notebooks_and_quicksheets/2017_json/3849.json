{"id": 3849, "text": "Subsequent to the initial transaction, the principal and interest payments on the\noriginal loans are allocated to pay servicing fees to the servicer and principal and interest\npayments to the owners of the ABS. Often there are several classes of ABS issued by the\ntrust, each with different priority claims to the cash flows from the underlying loans and\ndifferent specifications of the payments to be received if the cash flows from the loans\nare not sufficient to pay all the promised ABS cash flows. This flow of funds structure is\ncalled a waterfall structure because each class of ABS (tranche) is paid sequentially, to\nthe extent possible, from the cash flows from the underlying loan portfolio.\n"}
