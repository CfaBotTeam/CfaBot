{"id": "2932", "text": "Professor's Note: If you have the Profesional model of the Ti calculator, you can\neasily calculate the payback period and the discounted payback period (which\nfollows). Once NPV is displayed, use the down arrow to scroll through NEV\n(net future value), to PB (payback), and DPB (discounted payback). You must\nuse the compute key when \u201cPB=\u201d is displayed. If the annual net cash flows are\nequal, the payback period is simply project cost divided by the annual cash flow.\n"}
