{"id": "3554", "text": "Historically, REIT index returns and global equity returns have had a relatively strong\ncorrelation (on the order of 0.6) because business cycles affect REITs and global equities\nsimilarly. The correlation between global bond returns and REIT returns has been\nvery low historically. In either case diversification benefits can result from including\nreal estate in an investor's portfolio. However, the methods of index construction\n(e.g., appraisal or repeat sales indices) may be a factor in the low reported correlations,\nin which case actual diversification benefits may be less than expected.\n"}
