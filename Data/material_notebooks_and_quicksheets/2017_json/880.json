{"id": "880", "text": "Securities may have one or more types of risk, and each added risk increases the required\nrate of return on the security. These types of risk are:\n\u2022 Default risk. The risk that a borrower will not make the promised payments in a\ntimely manner.\nLiquidity risk. The risk of receiving less than fair value for an investment if it must\nbe sold for cash quickly.\nMaturity risk. As we will cover in detail in the section on debt securities, the prices\nof longer-term bonds are more volatile than those of shorter-term bonds. Longer\nmaturity bonds have more maturity risk than shorter-term bonds and require a\nmaturity risk premium.\nEach of these risk factors is associated with a risk premium that we add to the nominal\nrisk-free rate to adjust for greater default risk, less liquidity, and longer maturity relative\nto a very liquid, short-term, default risk-free rate such as that on T-bills. We can write:\nrequired interest rate on a security = nominal risk-free rate\n+ default risk premium\n+ liquidity premium\n+ maturity risk premium\n"}
