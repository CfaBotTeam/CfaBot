{"id": 1939, "text": "Merchandising firms, such as wholesalers and retailers, purchase inventory that is ready\nfor sale. In this case, inventory is reported in one account on the balance sheet. On\nthe other hand, manufacturing firms normally report inventory using three separate\naccounts: raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods. Analysts can use these\ndisclosures, along with other sources of information such as Management's Discussion\nand Analysis, economic data specific to the industry, industry trade publications, and\nother sections of the firm's financial reports, as a signal of a firm's future revenues and\nearnings.\n"}
