{"id": 377, "text": "The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution that has been standardized so\nthat it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1 [i.e., N-(0,1)]. To standardize\nan observation from a given normal distribution, the z-value of the observation must be\ncalculated. The z-value represents the number of standard deviations a given observation\nis from the population mean. Standardization is the process of converting an observed\nvalue for a random variable to its z-value. The following formula is used to standardize a\nrandom variable:\n"}
