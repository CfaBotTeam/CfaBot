{"id": "2300", "text": "Our result is that the risk (standard deviation of returns) and expected return of\nportfolios with varying weights in the risk-free asset and a risky portfolio can be\nplotted as a line that begins at the risk-free rate of return and extends through the risky\nportfolio. This result is illustrated in Figure 1.\n"}
