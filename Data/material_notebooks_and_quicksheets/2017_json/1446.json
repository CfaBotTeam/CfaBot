Real GDP measures the output of the economy using prices from a base year,\nremoving the effect of changes in prices so that inflation is not counted as economic\ngrowth.\nReal GDP is calculated relative to a base year. By using base-year prices and current-year\noutput quantities, real GDP growth reflects only increases in total output, not simply\nincreases (or decreases) in the money value of total output.\n"}
