{"id": 2841, "text": "The analyst should be sure that any comparables used really are comparable. Price\nmultiples may not be comparable across firms if the firms are different sizes, are in\ndifferent industries, or will grow at different rates. Furthermore, using P/E ratios for\ncyclical firms is complicated due to their sensitivity to economic conditions. In this case,\nthe P/S ratio may be favored over the P/E ratio because the sales are less volatile than\nearnings due to both operating and financial leverage.\nThe disadvantages of using price multiples based on comparables are (1) a stock may\nappear overvalued by the comparable method but undervalued by the fundamental\nmethod, or vice versa; (2) different accounting methods can result in price multiples that\nare not comparable across firms, especially internationally; and (3) price multiples for\ncyclical firms may be greatly affected by economic conditions at a given point in time.\n"}
