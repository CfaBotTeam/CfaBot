The auditor is satisfied that the statements were prepared in accordance with\naccepted accounting principles and that the principles chosen and estimates made\nare reasonable. The auditor's report must also contain additional explanation when\naccounting methods have not been used consistently between periods.\nAn unqualified opinion (also known as a clean opinion) indicates that the auditor believes\nthe statements are free from material omissions and errors. If the statements make any\nexceptions to the accounting principles, the auditor may issue a qualified opinion and\nexplain these exceptions in the audit report. The auditor can issue an adverse opinion if\nthe statements are not presented fairly or are materially nonconforming with accounting\nstandards. If the auditor is unable to express an opinion (e.g., in the case of a scope\nlimitation), a disclaimer of opinion is issued.\n"}
