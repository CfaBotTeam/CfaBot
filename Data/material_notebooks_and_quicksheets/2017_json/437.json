{"id": 437, "text": "Exam Focus\nThis topic review covers random samples and inferences about population means from\nsample data. It is essential that you know the central limit theorem, for it allows us to\nuse sampling statistics to construct confidence intervals for point estimates of population\nmeans. Make sure you can calculate confidence intervals for population means given\nsample parameter estimates and a level of significance, and know when it is appropriate\nto use the z-statistic versus the t-statistic. You should also understand the basic\nprocedures for creating random samples, and recognize the warning signs of various\nsampling biases from nonrandom samples.\n"}
