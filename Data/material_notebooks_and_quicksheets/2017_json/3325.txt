{"id": 3325, "text": "Credit enhancement can be either internal (built into the structure of a bond issue)\nor external (provided by a third party). One method of internal credit enhancement\nis overcollateralization, in which the collateral pledged has a value greater than the par\nvalue of the debt issued. One limitation of this method of credit enhancement is that\nthe additional collateral is also the underlying assets, so when asset defaults are high, the\nvalue of the excess collateral declines in value.\n"}
