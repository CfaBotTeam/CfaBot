{"id": "3365", "text": "When a bondholder sells a coupon bond prior to maturity, it may be at a gain or a loss\nrelative to its purchase price. Such gains and losses are considered capital gains income\n(rather than ordinary taxable income). Capital gains are often taxed at a lower rate than\nordinary income. Capital gains on the sale of an asset that has been owned for more than\nsome minimum amount of time may be classified as long-term capital gains and taxed at\nan even lower rate.\n"}
