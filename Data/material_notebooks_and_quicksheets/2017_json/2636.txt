{"id": 2636, "text": "Other calendar anomalies that were found at one time but no longer appear to persist\nare the turn-of-the-month effect (stock returns are higher in the days surrounding month\nend), the day-of-the-week effect (average Monday returns are negative), the weekend effect\n(positive Friday returns are followed by negative Monday returns), and the holiday effect\n(pre-holiday returns are higher).\nOverreaction and momentum anomalies. The overreaction effect refers to the finding\nthat firms with poor stock returns over the previous three or five years (losers) have\nbetter subsequent returns than firms that had high stock returns over the prior period.\nThis pattern has been attributed to investor overreaction to both unexpected good\nnews and unexpected bad news. This pattern is also present for bonds and in some\ninternational markets. Momentum effects have also been found where high shortterm returns are followed by continued high returns. This pattern is present in some\ninternational markets as well.\n"}
