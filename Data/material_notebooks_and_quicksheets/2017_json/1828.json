{"id": 1828, "text": "Company B has a higher tax burden but a lower interest burden (a lower ratio\nindicates a higher burden). Company B has better EBIT margins and better asset\nutilization (perhaps management of inventory, receivables, or payables, or a lower cost\nbasis in its fixed assets due to their age), and less leverage. Its higher EBIT margins\nand asset turnover are the main factors leading to its significantly higher ROE, which\nit achieves with less leverage than Company A.\n"}
