{"id": 983, "text": "When there are few or no good substitutes for a good, demand tends to be relatively\ninelastic. Consider a drug that keeps you alive by regulating your heart. If two pills per\nday keep you alive, you are unlikely to decrease your purchases if the price goes up and\nalso quite unlikely to increase your purchases if price goes down.\nWhen one or more goods are very good substitutes for the good in question, demand\nwill tend to be very elastic. Consider two gas stations along your regular commute that\noffer gasoline of equal quality. A decrease in the posted price at one station may cause\nyou to purchase all your gasoline there, while a price increase may lead you to purchase\nall your gasoline at the other station. Remember, we calculate demand and elasticity\nwhile holding the prices of related goods (in this case, the price of gas at the other\nstation) constant.\n"}
