For example, in the preceding equation, P,\nis the price at the end of Year 2. Think of it as the selling price of a share,\nimmediately after D, is received.\nExample: Multiple-period DDM valuation\nA stock recently paid a dividend of $1.00 which is expected to grow at 5% per year.\nThe required rate of return of 13.2%. Calculate the value of this stock assuming that\nit will be priced at $14.12 two years from now.\n"}
