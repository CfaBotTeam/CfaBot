{"id": 3594, "text": "Essentially, the owner of a convertible bond has the downside protection (compared to\nequity shares) of a bond, but at a reduced yield, and the upside opportunity of equity\nshares. For this reason convertible bonds are often referred to as a hybrid security, part\ndebt and part equity.\nTo issuers, the advantages of issuing convertible bonds are a lower yield (interest cost)\ncompared to straight bonds and the fact that debt financing is converted to equity\nfinancing when the bonds are converted to common shares. Some terms related to\nconvertible bonds are:\nConversion price. The price per share at which the bond (at its par value) may be\nconverted to common stock.\nConversion ratio. Equal to the par value of the bond divided by the conversion\nprice. If a bond with a $1,000 par value has a conversion price of $40, its conversion\nratio is 1,000/40 = 25 shares per bond.\n"}
