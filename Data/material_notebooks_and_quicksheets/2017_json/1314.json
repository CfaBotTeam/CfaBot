{"id": "1314", "text": "In the case of a firm under perfect competition, price = marginal revenue = average\nrevenue, as we have noted. For a firm under perfect competition (a price taker), we can\nuse a graph of cost functions to examine the profitability of the firm at different output\nprices. In Figure 5, at price P, price and average revenue equal average total cost. At the\noutput level of Point A, the firm is making an economic profit of zero. At a price above\nP, economic profit is positive, and at prices less than P, economic profit is negative\n(the firm has economic losses).\n"}
