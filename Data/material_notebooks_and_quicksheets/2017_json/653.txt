C There is no consistent relationship between the mean and standard deviation of the\nchi-square distribution or F-distribution.\n21. B The F-test is the appropriate test.\n22. C A test of o? = 0,is a x\u00ba test.\n23. A Since the observations are likely dependent (both related to market returns), a paired\ncomparisons (mean differences) test is appropriate and is based on a t-statistic.\n24. C When the variances are assumed to be unequal, we just calculate the denominator\n(standard error) differently and use both sample variances to calculate the t-statistic.\n25. C A Type I error is rejecting the null hypothesis when it's true. The probability of rejecting\na false null is [1 - Prob Type II] = [1 - 0.60] = 40%, which is called the power of the\ntest. A and B are not necessarily true, since the null may be false and the probability of\nrejection unknown.\n"}
