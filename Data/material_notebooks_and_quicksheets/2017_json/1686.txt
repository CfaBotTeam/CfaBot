{"id": 1686, "text": "Professor i Note: There are many ways to think about these calculations and\nlots of sources and uses and pluses and minuses to keep track of. It's easier if you\nuse a \u201c+\u201d sign for net sales and a \u201c-\u201d sign for cost of goods sold and other cash\nexpenses used as the starting points. Doing so will allow you to consistently\nfollow the rule that an increase in assets or decrease in liabilities is a use of cash\nand a decrease in assets or an increase in liabilities is a source. We'll use this\napproach in the answer to the example. Remember, sources are always + and\nuses are always \u2013.\n"}
