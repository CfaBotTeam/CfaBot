{"id": 1749, "text": "Analysts must also be aware of the limitations of ratios, including the following:\nFinancial ratios are not useful when viewed in isolation. They are only informative\nwhen compared to those of other firms or to the company's historical performance.\nComparisons with other companies are made more difficult by different accounting\ntreatments. This is particularly important when comparing U.S. firms to non-U.S.\nfirms.\nIt is difficult to find comparable industry ratios when analyzing companies that\noperate in multiple industries.\nConclusions cannot be made by calculating a single ratio. All ratios must be viewed\nrelative to one another.\nDetermining the target or comparison value for a ratio is difficult, requiring some\nrange of acceptable values.\nIt is important to understand that the definitions of ratios can vary widely among the\nanalytical community. For example, some analysts use all liabilities when measuring\nleverage, while other analysts only use interest-bearing obligations. Consistency is\nparamount. Analysts must also understand that reasonable values of ratios can differ\namong industries.\n"}
