{"id": "2988", "text": "One cautionary note regarding the simple logic behind Figure 1 is in order. All projects\ndo not have the same risk. The WACC is the appropriate discount rate for projects that\nhave approximately the same level of risk as the firm's existing projects. This is because\nthe component costs of capital used to calculate the firm's WACC are based on the\nexisting level of firm risk. To evaluate a project with greater than (the firm's) average\nrisk, a discount rate greater than the firm's existing WACC should be used. Projects with\nbelow-average risk should be evaluated using a discount rate less than the firm's WACC.\n"}
