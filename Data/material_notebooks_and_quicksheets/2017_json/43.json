{"id": 43, "text": "Problems Associated with the IRR Method\nWhen the acceptance or rejection of one project has no effect on the acceptance or\nrejection of another, the two projects are considered to be independent projects.\nWhen only one of two projects may be accepted, the projects are considered to be\nmutually exclusive. For mutually exclusive projects, the NPV and IRR methods can\ngive conflicting project rankings. This can happen when the projects initial costs are of\ndifferent sizes or when the timing of the cash flows is different. Let's look at an example\nthat illustrates how NPV and IRR can yield conflicting results.\nExample: Conflicting decisions between NPV and IRR\nAssume NPV and IRR analysis of two mutually exclusive projects produced the\nresults shown in the following figure. As indicated, the IRR criteria recommends\nthat Project A should be accepted. On the other hand, the NPV criteria indicates\nacceptance of Project B. Which project should be selected?\nRanking Reversals With NPV and IRR\nProject Investment at t = 0 Cash Flow at t = 1\nIRR\nA-$5,000\n-$5,000\n$8,000\n60%\n$2,272.72\n\u0412\n-$30,000\n$40,000\n33%\n$6,363.64\n"}
