	<question id="66">In a recent meeting of the Board of Directors of Singh Semiconductors, the Board was discussing deferred taxes and the effective tax rate reconciliation disclosures. The Board wanted to learn more about this topic because low effective tax rates relative to the effective tax rates of comparable companies are a potential red flag. At the meeting the following two statements were made by Board members: Statement 1: When analyzing a firm&#8217;s effective tax rate reconciliation disclosures, analysts watch out for companies that report high income tax expense on their financial statements compared to taxes payable because such companies are more likely to be using aggressive accounting methods and have low-quality earnings. Statement 2: High effective tax rates may result when a firm has significant restructuring charges since restructuring charges do not generally have tax cash flow effects in the year they are recorded, but can have significant effects on future cash flows. Are Statements 1 and 2 as made by Singh Semiconductor&#8217;s Board members correct or incorrect? Statement 1	Statement 2</question>

You can therefore treat the morning and afternoon exams as independent events. If you took more than three hours (180 minutes) to complete this portion of the exam, you should adjust your score downward by one point for each minute you ran over. Remember: the real exam will be more difficult than these practice exams. The main reason for this is the general anxiety andistress that you will be feeling oh exam day, coupled with the time pressure you will be under. Many of the questions on this practice exam and the real exam are not individually difficult, so if you take extra time to answer the questions on this practice exam, your score will go up significantly. However, if you want an accurate measure of your potential performance on the exam, adhere to the 3-hour time limit. After you have finished grading your practice exam, you may find it useful to use the exam questions and recommended solutions for review purposes (as flash review points). Many of these questions were specifically written for your use as study tools. Once again, I feel I should remind you not to memorize these questions; you will not see them on the actual exam. What you will see on the exam, though, are the concepts, terms, and procedures presented in these questions. Your actual exam will most likely &#8220;look diiFerent77 than what you see in this book.

Management views this project as being riskier than the average project the company undertakes. Based on their analysis of the projected cash flows, management determines that the project&#8217;s internal rate of return is equal to the company&#8217;s marginal cost of capital. If the project goes forward, the company will finance it with newly issued debt with an after-tax cost less than the project&#8217;s IRR. Should management accept or reject this project?</question>
	<choices>
		<choice id="A">Accept, because the project returns the company&#8217;s cost of capital.</choice>
		<choice id="B">Accept, because the marginal cost of the new debt is less than the project&#8217;s internal rate of return.</choice>
		<choice id="C">Reject, because the project reduces the value of the company when its risk is taken into account.</choice>
